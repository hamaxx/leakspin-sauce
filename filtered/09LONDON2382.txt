SUBJECT: IRAN/AMERICAN DETAINEES: HMG UNABLE TO PROVIDE 
DIRECT ASSISTANCE  REF: A. A. STATE 94757      B. B. LONDON 2178  Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Greg Berry, reasons 1.4 (b)  and (d).  

1. (C) Following up on her September 16 meeting (ref B) with Helen Teasdale of the Foreign and Commonwealth's Iran office, London Iran Watcher asked if HMG had made a decision regarding raising the issue of American detainees with the Iranian government.  Teasdale explained the U.S. request for assistance had been discussed both in London and with the UK mission in Tehran.  Given the very limited access the UK currently has to the Iranian government and the tense bilateral relationship between the two countries (especially in the wake of the October 18 suicide bombing in Baluchistan, for which the Iranian regime has publicly blamed the UK), as well as HMG's continued concern over its local staff members detained after the June elections, HMG is not in a position to provide direct assistance on the issue of the American detainees.  Teasdale suggested the U.S. instead approach the Swedish government in its capacity as EU president for help. She noted the Swedes enjoy regular access to the Iranian government, and likely would be in a better position to offer assistance.  HMG would fully support a Swedish-led EU approach to the Iranian regime on behalf of the United States.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
