Classified by: Economic-Political Counselor Philip Kaplan 
(acting) for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Polchief discussed agenda items for the July 27-28 
GAERC on July 22 with Klaus Famira, MFA European 
Correspondent.  Famira said GAERC participants will discuss 
EU-Iran relations in light of the latest election and the 
crackdown on protesters.  They will consider options for 
handling the inauguration for President Ahmadinejad.  One 
option, Famira said, would be for EU embassies in Teheran to 
send deputies to the event, while another would be for 
Ambassadors to attend on the understanding that they will 
leave en masse if Ahmadinejad makes any "unacceptable" 
comments. 
 
2. (C) Famira said the EU will also consider whether to 
informally obstruct the travel of Iranian officials involved 
in the crackdown on post-election demonstrations.  Under one 
proposal, EU missions in Teheran would be advised to delay 
the processing of visa applications from certain Iranian 
officials.  Famira said GAERC participants are not expected 
to make any decisions regarding tightening Iran sanctions, 
nor are they planning to discuss Iran's nuclear program in 
depth.  He said participants are also not expected to discuss 
the detention of UK embassy personnel; he noted that the UK 
employees have been released, while acknowledging that a 
French citizen remains in custody. 
 
3. (U) Famira said participants will also discuss Iceland's 
decision to seek EU membership.  Some member states will 
likely argue that the EU should complete the Lisbon Treaty 
process before initiating accession talks with Iceland. 
Others are expected to raise concerns about fisheries and a 
possible perception of unfairness if Iceland is moved ahead 
of longstanding EU aspirants like Turkey, Croatia and Albania. 
 
4. (U) GOA views on the question of U.S. participation in the 
EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia were reported reftel B.
