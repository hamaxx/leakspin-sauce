SUBJECT: EAC ON PREPAREDNESS FOR PANDEMIC FLU OUTBREAK 
 
REF: A. A. STATE 006306 
     B. B. STATE 043249 
 
1.      The Emergency Action Committee (EAC) convened on April 30, 2009, chaired by the Chief of Mission. The following attended the meeting: Deputy Chief of Mission, Regional Security Officer, Regional Affairs Officer, Defense Attachi, Community Liaison Officer, Medical Officer, Consul, Commercial Services Officer, Public Affairs Officer, and Political Officer. The committee reviewed Department guidance (reftel A) and took stock of post's preparedness for a pandemic as well as the Libyan government's response to the H1N1 virus situation.

2. There are no reported cases of H1N1 influenza in Libya to date. According to media reports, the Government of Libya convened a working group to monitor the potential pandemic influenza situation and the group plans to meet on a weekly basis. Officials at Tripoli's international airport have begun screening passengers. People travelling from countries with confirmed cases of H1N1 are screened for elevated temperatures and questioned about travel and contact histories. Post medical contacts report that the Government of Libya has placed an order for 100,000 courses of Tamiflu. The Health Unit has a stock of Tamiflu and expects a supplemental shipment shortly. Post also has an adequate supply of personal protective equipment. Post expects H1N1 diagnostic kits in the near future. The Embassy community has received information on personal hygiene and H1N1 influenza. Post management has confirmed the availability of adequate emergency supplies of food and water. Major airlines serving Tripoli confirm the availability of seats with 24-48 hours notice and ten days to charter an entire aircraft.

3. The consular section has received few inquiries from the community about H1N1. On the EAC's recommendation, the consular section issued a warden message using the Department-recommended template (reftel B) and adding additional information about Libyan government actions to date. One visa recipient reportedly cancelled his travel to the United States over fears about the illness.

4. The EAC continues to monitor the situation and plans to reconvene if the situation warrants. In addition, EAC members continue to review tripwires at post and will make changes as necessary. CRETZ
