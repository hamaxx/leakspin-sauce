SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S LULA OFFERS BOLIVIA'S MORALES TREATMENT FOR TUMOR 

Classified By: Ambassador Clifford M. Sobel, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 

1. (C) In a conversation with Ambassador Sobel following the January 15, 2009 La Paz meeting between Brazilian President Lula and Bolivian President Morales, Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim (protect) confirmed an earlier rumor that Morales is suffering from a serious sinus tumor. Jobim told the Ambassador that Lula had offered Morales an examination and treatment at a Sao Paulo hospital. Although there have been been public reports that Morales needs surgery for "acute sinusitis," and related otitis and headaches, according to Jobim his problems in fact are caused by a serious tumor and the surgery will be an effort to remove it. Treatment has been put off, however, until after the constitutional referendum scheduled for January 25. Jobim, who attended the meeting between Lula and Morales, commented that the tumor might explain why Morales has seemed unfocussed and not his usual self at this and other recent meetings. SOBEL
