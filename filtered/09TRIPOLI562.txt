SUBJECT: AU SUMMIT: A/S CARSON'S MEETING WITH AU COMMISSION LEADERSHIP TRIPOLI 00000562 001.2 OF 002 

CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, US Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 

1. (C) Summary: Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Johnnie Carson and African Union (AU) Commission Chairperson Jean Ping met July 2 on the margins of the AU Summit in Sirte, Libya. They reviewed successful efforts by the AU and its international partners to reject military coup perpetrators, pledged to do more to restore order in Guinea-Bissau and fight narco-traffickers that threaten some African governments, and considered how to avert a political crisis in Niger. On Somalia, both sides agreed on the need to support the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and President Sheikh Sharif, and the urgent need to persuade Eritrea and Qatar to stop providing support to al-Shabaab. End Summary. 

2. (C) A/S Carson opened his meeting with the AU Commission's leadership by expressing his condolences to Chairperson Ping for his fellow countryman, the late Gabonese President Omar Bongo. Ping noted the close relationship between Gabon and the United States. When asked about the possibility of his succeeding Bongo, Ping chuckled and said he was not unemployed. 

UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT -- MAURITANIA, GUINEA, MADAGASCAR 

--------------------------------------------- --------------- 

3. (C) Carson lauded Ping for his strong position against unconstitutional changes of government in Mauritania, Guinea, and Madagascar. "The stand and the leadership you have exhibited have elevated the status of the AU on the issue of democracy," Carson said. Ping, who was accompanied by Deputy Chairperson Erastus Mwencha, Commissioner for Peace and Security Ramtane Lamamra, and other senior AU Commission staff, returned the compliments, saying the United States had consistently held the line on democracywhile the Europeans, and particularly the French, were "dancing the tango." By maintaining a strong position in the various international contact groups established by the AU in the wake of the coups, the international community has ensured that none of the coups within the past year have succeeded, Ping said. 

GUINEA BISSAU: ELECTIONS AND NARCO-TRAFFICKING --------------------------------------------- - 

4. (C) On Guinea-Bissau, Ping said the AU was monitoring post-election developments closely. A second round of voting on July 26 will pit ruling party leader and former president Malam Bacai Sanha, who finished first with 39 percent of the vote in the first round, against another former president, Kumba Yala, who garnered 29 percent of the vote. President Joao Bernardo Vieira was killed by mutinous troops in March. Ping discussed establishing a stabilization force composed of Nigerians and Angolans, although Bissau has rejected this proposal. Drug trafficking is central to Guinea-Bissau's problems, Ping continued. The AU will need cooperation from Latin America, as well as Europe, to tackle the problem effectively and prevent it from spreading across the continent, Ping added. Carson agreed on the need for greater cooperation and urged more African states to turn over suspected traffickers to American and European authorities rather than simply expelling them. Ping said he would raise this issue with 

ECOWAS. NIGER: CONCERNS ABOUT TANDJA 
---------------------------- 

5. (C) Turning to Niger, both sides expressed deep concern about President Mamadou Tandja's attempts to prolong his mandate by changing the constitution -- over the objections of the courts, much of Nigerien public opinion, and some in the military. The risk of a coup is real. Carson asked what measures the AU might adopt to prevent a coup. Ping suggested getting Nigeria to engage more forcefully on the issue. The AU prefers a quiet approach so as not to embarrass Niger. Former Ghanaian president, John Kufuor, was asked to go to Niamey, but he was unable to do so, but when the AU sent a team from its Abidjan office, Tandja reportedly rejected their demarche. TRIPOLI 00000562 002.2 OF 002 

SOMALIA: ERITREA SUPPORT FOR AL-SHABAAB A PROXY WAR --------------------------------------------- ------ 

6. (C) Carson and Ping also discussed the situation in Somalia. A/S Carson detailed the USG position in support of President Sheikh Sharif, the Somali Transitional Federal Government, and the Djibouti process. U.S. support has come in the form of weapons and cash for TFG security force salaries, but also in the form of encouragement to troop contributing countries Burundi and Uganda, and follow-up with various countries to fulfill their pledges in Brussels in May. Carson briefed the AU leadership on U.S. efforts to persuade Eritrea to stop meddling in Somalia. There is a growing body of evidence to prove that Eritrea is both a conduit of money and provider of funds to al-Shabaab, Carson told Ping. Eritrea's President, Isaias Afewerki, appears to be supporting al-Shabaab not because he is pro-extremist, but because he is fighting a proxy war with Ethiopia. Qatar's role in support of al-Shabaab has also been unhelpful. Ping said the AU has openly complained about Eritrea's negative role, and it has asked the Arab League to investigate. (Note: The AU Summit concluded with African leaders adopting a resolution asking the UN to impose sanctions on Eritrea for its support of armed groups. The same resolution asked the UN to impose a sea blockade and no-fly zone. End note.) 

7. (C) Ping emphasized that the AU cannot afford to be defeated in Somalia, and called on the Arab League to stand with the AU since Somalia belongs to both organizations. Qatar, he said, is a partner with the AU in trying to resolve the Darfur crisis and could be similarly helpful with regard to Somalia. Ping told Carson that he has advised Eritrea to recognize the change in U.S. policy toward Asmara, but that if the Government of Eritrea does not make amends, it will miss a unique opportunity. Carson said the United States is reaching out to Eritrea, but Asmara risks further international isolation. Ping concurred, saying that frustration was spreading. "Even Zambia is fed up," he said. Ping said he intends to go to Asmara himself to pursue the diplomatic track with Afewerki. 

8. (C) Carson warned of a "cascading set of problems" in the Horn of Africa should Somali President Sheikh Sharif fall to al-Shabaab. He cited more foreign fighters, humanitarian challenges, refugees, smuggling, piracy, and political chaos. Ping pledged AU cooperation to prevent the Somali situation from worsening. He applauded the USG for taking a risk by sending cash to the TFG for its security forces and other support. Ping still believes Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Malawi will make good on promises to contribute troops to AMISOM. Lamamra voiced concern that European partners may withhold support if AMISOM receives an enforcement mandate rather than remaining a protective mission. 

PING APPEALS FOR POTUS TO ATTEND NEXT AU SUMMIT --------------------------------------------- -- 

9. (C) The meeting concluded with Ping renewing an earlier invitation for POTUS to address the next AU Summit. Ping appealed to the Obama Administration to include Africa's voice at international fora, such as the G-20. He also praised POTUS for his Cairo speech to the Muslim world, and said Africans looked forward to POTUS' expected speech in Ghana on July 11. "We count on you. We are ready to go with you," Ping told Carson. 

10. (U) A/S Carson has approved this message. CRETZ
