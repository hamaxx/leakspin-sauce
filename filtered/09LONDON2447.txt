(Ref)  Boyles affirmed the importance of coordination among allies and said she would discuss this matter with FCO colleagues.  

2.  (C)  Stephanie Fuller, Desk Officer at the FCO's Afghanistan Group, shared the following paper with Poloff October 28, characterizing it as "our response on governor appointments:"  Begin text:  Engaging Afghan Government on Governor Appointments  The UK is fully committed to ensuring the appointment of effective governors in Afghanistan.  We have regularly engaged with the Afghan government on the importance of making clean and competent governor appointments. We agree that the international community needs to better co-ordinate engagement with the Afghan government on this issue.  A more co-ordinated approach is needed both in establishing a general criteria for appointments, and in instances where particular appointments need addressing. Our Embassy in Kabul is already developing plans to work with the Afghan government to establish terms of reference for governors.  This should be a joint endeavour; our embassies should work together developing a joint plan of action for engaging the Afghan government on appointments.  End text.
