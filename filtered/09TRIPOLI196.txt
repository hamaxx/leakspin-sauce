SUBJECT: TWEAKING THE TIGERS' TAIL: SAIF AL-ISLAM OPENS NEW HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN LIBYA REF: A) 08 TRIPOLI 960, B) TRIPOLI 0022 TRIPOLI 00000196 001.2 OF 002 CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, U.S. Embassy - Tripoli, U.S. Dept of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

1.(C) Summary: Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi has established a new human rights organization, the Arab Alliance for Democracy, Development and Human Rights, whose mandate would consist of tracking human rights abuses in the Middle East, to include identifying specific individuals who perpetrate abuses and targeting them for sanctions. An initial meeting of NGO representatives from the region took place in Tripoli; Saif al-Islam was elected honorary chair, and the organization is "up and running". The organization has been in touch with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch about how to be an effective human rights organization, and has invited Human Rights Watch, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republic Institute to visit Libya. End summary. SAIF AL-ISLAM ANNOUNCES NEW HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION

2.(SBU) International media reported on the margins of the recent World Economic Forum in Davos that Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi and Chairman of the quasi-governmental Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF), had announced his intention to establish a human rights organization whose mandate would include tracking human rights abuses in the Middle East. The QDF's Executive Director, Yusuf Sawani, told the DCM on February 22 that the new organization had been established and was " ... up and running". The new entity, named the Arab Alliance for Democracy, Development and Human Rights (AADDHR), was headquartered in Tripoli and was separate from the QDF. An initial meeting, attended by NGO representatives from more than 20 countries, was held in Tripoli in mid-February. Saif al-Islam was elected Chairman of the AADDHR, an honorary position, and Dr. Ali Said Ali, a professor from Libya's Gar Younis University, was appointed General Coordinator. Saif al-Islam also recently announced that he intends to open a democracy research institute in Europe (London and Vienna, two cities he knows well, have been mentioned), which could afford a more removed platform from which to pursue issues still deemed neuralgic by some in Libya. WHICH WILL PURSUE A "NAME AND SHAME" POLICY AND IS IN TOUCH WITH WESTERN NGOS

3.(C) In his announcement at Davos, Saif al-Islam said that among the new organization's goals was an initiative to develop a mechanism to identify individuals who had perpetrated human rights abuses, maintain a database listing details of those acts and target those individuals for sanctions. Sawani confirmed that organizations in attendance at the mid-February meeting had endorsed the "name and shame" policy, and said it would be initiated "soon". Before Saif al-Islam's announcement in Davos, contacts at the QDF and the affiliated Human Rights Society of Libya (HRSL) told P/E Chief they were concerned that Libya could open itself to considerable criticism if the new organziation actually implemented the plan. Externally-based Libyan opposition groups have been carefully collecting information about the GOL's human rights abuses and would likely submit copious listing requests. Those contacts also expressed concern that Saif al-Islam, who has had a series of disagreements in recent months with his brother, Muatassim (the National Security Adviser), and conservative regime elements (some of whom would likely be eligible for listing as human rights abusers), could be giving his opponents within Libya another cudgel with which to beat him.

4.(SBU) Sawani said the AADDHR had been in touch with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch about how to be an effective human rights organization. Following up on meetings between U.S.-based human rights NGOs and Saif al-Islam during the latter's visit to the U.S. late last year, the AADDHR has invited HRW, the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute to visit Libya. In addition, Sawani and Ali applied for U.S. visas on February 25 and expect to travel to the U.S. in the next several days to continue discussions with U.S. human rights NGOs. EFFICACY MAY DEPEND IN PART ON SAIF AL-ISLAM'S STRUGGLE WITH CONSERVATIVE LIBYAN REGIME ELEMENTS

5.(C) The announcement of the new organization at Davos coincided with the arrest of Dr. Juma'a Atiaga, who was detained on allegations that he was involved in a banned political organization and had a hand in the 1984 assasination of Libya's former Ambassador to Rome, Ammar Daw. In interviews with al-Sharq al-Awsat at the time, Saif al-Islam decried the arrest as "ridiculous". The QDF issued a statement on its website calling for Atiaga's release and criticizing GOL authorities for having arrested Atiaga while ignoring other cases involving allegations of human rights abuses that the QDF had brought to TRIPOLI 00000196 002.2 OF 002 the attention of prosecutors. Well-informed contacts in Libya have reported that Prime Minister-equivalent al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, who has been engaged in a quiet struggle with Saif al-Islam, ordered the Prosecutor General for north Tripoli to make the arrest. Other reports suggest that National Security Adviser Muatassim al-Qadhafi orchestrated the arrest through the Prime Minister's office in retaliation for Saif's encroachment on a business deal Muatassim was trying to broker. Atiaga was released on February 16, but the investigation against him continues.

6.(C) Comment: Human rights remains one of the most sensitive issues in Libya, particularly for conservative regime elements, many of whom personally played a part in the most serious transgressions of the late 1970's and 1980's. Most human rights initiatives backed by Saif al-Islam and the QDF (the Bulgarian nurses, families of victims of the 1996 Abu Salim prison massacre, the release of former Libyan Islamic Fighting Group members) have downplayed personal responsibility and focused on compensation as a means to resolve old grievances. Identifying and seeking to hold accountable specific individuals would be a significant evolution. While the AADDHR is formally focused on events throughout the region, the fact that it is headquartered in Tripoli and operating under Saif al-Islam's auspices will make it hard for old guard elements to swallow. The extent to which it is able to effectively operate - particularly with respect to allegations of abuses involving Libyan officials - remains to be seen. Saif al-Islam has a reputation for making sensational public announcements about new initiatives and then not following through. In that regard, the QDF's fitful role as a mediator in the case of detained human rights activist Fathi el-Jahmi (ref A and previous), and the involvement of a senior lieutenant of Saif's in recent attacks against Berbers (ref B), afford cautionary tales with respect to how much we can reasonably expect from the new-constituted AADDHR. Nonetheless, the new organization could present a useful portal for USG and foreign NGO engagement with Libya on human rights issues. End comment. CRETZ
