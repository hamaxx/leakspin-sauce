SUBJECT: AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY - UK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO 
SUSTAINMENT AND SUPPORTS BROAD MANDATE FOR NATO TRUST FUND  REF: STATE 125172  Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  

1.  (C/NF)  The UK concurs with U.S. views (reftel) that the NATO Afghanistan National Army (ANA) Trust Fund mandate should be broad and flexible enough to allow contributions from both NATO and non-Nato nations alike.  FCO NATO/ESDP Team Leader Chris Holtby added that the disbursal system should be structured to allow contributing nations to choose how their donations are spent within the requirements identified by Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan (CSTC-A).  Holtby said that the UK would work with the U.S. and like-minded Allies on endorsement of broadening the mandate along those lines at the December 2-3 NATO Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels.  

2.  (C/NF)  HMG also recognizes that expanding the ANA from 86,000 to 134,000 troops will require significant international contributions for training and sustainment, and intends to "do our part," according to FCO Afghanistan Office Director Matthew Lodge.  He said the UK is currently reviewing its entire package of support to Afghanistan, including for the "political surge" in the run-up to elections, and ANA requirements are part of that review.  He said no firm decisions had been made on the exact dollar figure to be allocated to ANA sustainment, but was sure that USD 100m per year over the next four years was "beyond what the UK's budget could stand."  The UK will join the U.S. and other like-minded Allies at the Ministerial in calling for greater burden sharing across the board in Afghanistan, according to Lodge.
