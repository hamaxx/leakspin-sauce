SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: PALESTINIAN 
ISSUES 
 
REF: A. 08 STATE 001379 
     B. 08 STATE 64936 
 
 
Classified By: CATHERINE BROWN, DAS, INR/IPC. REASON: 1.4(C). 
 
1. (S/NF) SUMMARY:  This cable provides the full text of the 
new National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on 
Palestinian Issues (paragraph 3-end) and encourages 
Department personnel at post to assist in compiling 
Palestinian biographic information (paragraph 2). 
 
A. (S/NF) The NHCD results from a recent Washington review of 
reporting and collection needs for Palestinian Issues and 
sets forth a list of priorities intended to guide 
participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
update plans to collect information on Palestinian Issues. 
The priorities may also help the Embassy manage reporting and 
collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans 
(MSPs). 
 
B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
 
C. (S/NF) Important information responsive to the NHCD often 
is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose 
agencies participated in the review leading to the NHCD's 
issuance.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
Department channels. 
 
2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting - including on 
Palestinians: 
 
A.  (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
and other means is vital to the community's collection 
efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
dissemination to the IC.  State reporting officers are 
encouraged to report on noteworthy Palestinians as 
information becomes available. 
 
B.  (S/NF) When it is available, reporting officers should 
include as much of the following information as possible: 
office and organizational titles; names, position titles and 
other information on business cards; numbers of telephones, 
cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact 
information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc 
or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings; 
internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, 
web site identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; 
frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other 
relevant biographical information.
