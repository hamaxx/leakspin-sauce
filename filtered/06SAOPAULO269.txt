 SUBJECT: LEBANESE SUSPECT IN HARIRI ASSASSINATION ARRESTED IN BRAZIL 

REF: 05 BEIRUT 2216 

1. (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia. 

2. (SBU) Sao Paulo State Civil Police arrested Rana Abdel Rahim Koleilat (PDOB Lebanon 23 JAN 1976) on March 12 based on an Interpol warrant for her involvement in the mid-2003 collapse of the Lebanese-based Al-Madina Bank. She is the main suspect in the USD one billion fraud that allegedly involved money laundering for various Islamic extremist groups. Koleilat was arrested in the Parthenon Accor Hotel in the Santana district of Sao Paulo based on an anonymous tip. She had a British passport (suspected to be fake) with her real name, as well an Egyptian passport with the name Fakhriya Mhanna. A Civil Police spokesman told the press that Koleilat tried to bribe Brazilian police with USD 200,000 in an unsuccessful attempt to release her. Lebanese Consul General in Sao Paulo Joseph Sayah told us that she has apparently been in Brazil for six months (including in Rio de Janeiro and other cities) and is in an illegal immigration status in Brazil since she had overstayed her initial entry permit, even if the passport she used turns out to be real. Sayah also told us that the UN Independent International Investigation Commission set up to look into the February 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri wants to question her with regard to the assassination, since Syrian Military Intelligence Chief Rustom Ghazaleh, the chief suspect in the Hariri assassination, was heavily involved in the Al-Madina Bank's money laundering scheme. 

3. (SBU) Koleilat is to be turned over shortly to the custody of the Federal Police, which has jurisdiction over Interpol cases. While Lebanese CG Sayah confirmed that Lebanon and Brazil do not have an extradition treaty, both Sayah and Civil Police contacts told us they expect Koleilat will be deported to Lebanon. He added that he has seen Koleilat in custody and that she seems willing to return to Lebanon. Sayah told us the UN Investigation Commission is aware of Koleilat's arrest and has communicated to the Brazilian Mission at the UN their request to interrogate her. Sayah asserted that all UN member countries, like Brazil, are obligated to assist the Commission. 

4. (SBU) Sayah, initially concerned that Koleilat would bribe her way to freedom, seems more confident she will stay in jail for now. Post has let various police contacts know our interest in keeping her detained until she can be removed to Lebanon. RSO is working via channels to ensure Interpol and the British Consulate act quickly to provide Brazilian police with whatever they need to move the case forward. 

5. (SBU) Action Request: Mission Brazil requests guidance from the Department on any actions to be taken with regard to the Koleilat case.
