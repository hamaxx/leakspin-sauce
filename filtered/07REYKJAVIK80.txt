SUBJECT: ICELAND APPROVES OF AHTISAARI'S WORK ON KOSOVO 
 
REF: A. STATE 37835 B. Reykjavik 20 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Carol van Voorst for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Valgerdur Sverrisdottir and 
MFA advisor Jorundur Valtysson on March 26 and conveyed our request 
for strong support for the recommendations of UN Special Envoy Martti 
Ahtisaari.  The Ambassador noted the MFA's positive comments last 
January on the Ahtisaari plan (ref B).  Sverrisdottir said the 
government had not yet discussed the Special Envoy's proposal but 
that she thought that Ahtisaari "had done great work and his proposal 
is good."  Sverrisdottir said she wanted to consult with her team 
before making a public statement but made it clear that generally she 
was positive towards Ahtisaari's plan.
