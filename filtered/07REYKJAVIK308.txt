SUBJECT: ICELAND WILL LIKELY ATTEND WIREC 2008 
 
 
1. Officials in the Natural Resource Department at the Icelandic 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs conveyed strong interest in attending 
Washington International Renewable Energy Conference in March 2008 
but were unable to give a confirmed delegation roster this far in 
advance.  Ambassador engaged Minister of Environment Thorunn 
Sveinbjarnadottir directly on October 25 and the Minister said she 
would make every effort to attend.  The Minister of Industry and his 
Director of Energy have also expressed interest in attending. 
 
2. Given Iceland's nearly one hundred percent use of renewable 
energy for electricity generation and home heating, and their 
increasing overseas investment and experience in geothermal energy 
projects, we believe that an Icelandic delegation will be an 
essential contributor to WIREC.
