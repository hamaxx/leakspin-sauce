SUBJECT: LIBYAN OFFICIALS CONFIRM AUGUST 31 AU MEETING IN TRIPOLI 
 
1.(SBU) In a July 26 meeting with NEA Acting Assistant Secretary Feltman (septel), Foreign Minister-equivalent Musa Kusa extended a verbal invitation for American officials to attend an African Union extraordinary session on August 31 focused on continental crises, specifically Sudan and Somalia. On July 27, Protocol chief Nuri al-Mismari told the Ambassador that the one-day session would be held in Tripoli and that the GOL was in the process of chartering ships to serve as floating hotels to house the expected delegates. The proposed ministerial-level meeting would be the day following a planned visit of Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi to mark the signing of the 2008 Italian-Libyan "Friendship Treaty" on August 30 and the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought Muammar al-Qadhafi to power on September 1.
