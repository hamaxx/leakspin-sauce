SUBJECT: DRC:UK SUPPORTS EITI INCLUSION IN MONUC MANDATE, EXTENDED ARMS EMBARGO, FDLR SANCTIONS IMPOSITION SOONEST  
REF: A. KIGALI 792      B. EMAILS LORD/CLARK  

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.5 (b/d)  

1. (C/NF) Summary. The UK supports inclusion of an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) paragraph in the MONUC renewal mandate, continuation of the arms embargo in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for 12 months, and imposition of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) sanctions to "keep the Rwandans on board."  HMG wants to hold a P-3 meeting before the end of December to discuss lobbying efforts for the additional troops for MONUC, prioritizing and refining the MONUC mandate before its year-end renewal, and efforts to disarm and repatriate the FDLR.  End summary.  

EITI Good In a Prioritized MONUC Mandate ----------------------------------------  

2. (C/NF) FCO Great Lakes Team Leader Dave Hall, FCO DRC Desk Office Oliver Craven, and FCO Sanctions Officer Dominic Otway told poloff November 28 that HMG supports inclusion of an EITI paragraph in the MONUC renewal mandate.  Craven noted that the mandate "needs to prioritize" and the "Security Council needs to give MONC direction."  Managing natural resources is a priority for HMG, especially given the high amount of parliamentary interest in the topic.  Craven, however, questioned how the South Africans and Chinese would react to inclusion of an EITI paragraph, and said we should be prepared for tough negotiations.  

P-3 Meeting Before Year's End 
-----------------------------  

3. (C/NF) Hall said that given the number of pressing issues on DRC, HMG wants to have a P-3 meeting before the end of December.  He said HMG would be happy to host or equally content to travel to Washington or Paris.  HMG would like to discuss lobbying efforts for the additional troops for MONUC, prioritizing and refining the MONUC mandate, and efforts to disarm and repatriate the FDLR.  Hall noted that Prime Minister Brown had recently sent a letter to the 13 countries the UN had identified as possible TCCs for MONUC.  HMG will follow up with Chief of Mission demarches in those capitals.  

Renewing the Arms Embargo For 12 Months ---------------------------------------  

4. (C/NF) HMG also supports continuation of the DRC arms embargo, which excludes the DRC Government.  Craven said HMG supports a 12-month renewal, putting the arms embargo and MONUC renewals on the same schedule.  HMG also supports extension of the Group of Experts' mandate.  

Sanctions to Keep the Rwandans Sweet 
------------------------------------  

5. (C/NF) Hall and Otway said FCO Ministers are "agitated" that FDLR sanctions have not been put in place yet, and HMG sees imposition of the sanctions as an easy way to keep the Rwandans on board and demonstrate that "Europe can be tough on the FDLR."  This is especially important in light of the Rose Kabuye arrest (reftel A).  Following FCO Minister for Africa Lord Malloch-Brown's visit to Rwanda, Malloch-Brown said HMG needs to "find something to give the Rwandans," and the FCO has determined it is the FDLR sanctions, even if the UNSC is only prepared to move forward on four individuals.
