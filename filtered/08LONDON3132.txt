SUBJECT: HMG SHARES USG CONCERNS ON UNESCO DG 
 
REF: STATE 130916  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)   

1. (C)  William Gatward of the FCO's International Organizations Department (Specialized Agencies Team) told Poloff that HMG was not in favor of Egypt's nomination of Culture Minister Farouk Hosni for Director General (DG) of UNESCO, but had made no official decision.  Gatward said that Hosni is "not the right man for the job," although Gatward said HMG is more concerned with his lack of administrative skills than his ethical/political inappropriateness.  Gatward also said that HMG is "nervous" that there appears to be no viable competition at this point, dismissing both the Lithuanian and Bulgarian proposed candidates as "unacceptably innocuous." He said that HMG is not sure how vocal it is willing to be regarding its objections to Hosni.  

2. (C)  Gatward said that HMG is not currently planning on an endorsement of Hosni. He said that HMG would welcome the opportunity to work with the USG on finding a viable alternative and requested that USG share the names of any possible candidates that USG might identify.
