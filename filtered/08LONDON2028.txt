SUBJECT: UK LIKELY TO JOIN EU CONSENSUS ON LIFTING KARADZIC 
FAMILY TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. 
 
REF: STATE 82494  Classified By: Political Counselor Richard M. Mills, Jr. for reasons 1. 4 (b) and (d).  1.  (C) Barring the reception of any further information linking Radovan Karadzic's family members to support networks for other Persons Indicted for War Crimes (PIFWCs), the UK will join EU consensus to lift travel restrictions which had been imposed on them.  FCO Balkans Office Deputy Director Adam Bye noted that the Office of the High Representative had approached EU officials in support of lifting the travel ban.  2.  (C) Bye suggested that if the U.S. has or develops information with linkages as suggested above, it should be shared with EU members, including the UK, as soon as possible.  He also suggested that if the U.S. delivers points reftel to the OHR and its support for lifting the ban is subsequently modified, there might be some chance that the EU would hold off on removing travel restrictions.
