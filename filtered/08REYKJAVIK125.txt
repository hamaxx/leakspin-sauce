SUBJECT: ICELAND RATIFIES PALERMO ANTI-TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
PROTOCOL 
 
REF:  REYKJAVIK 036 
 
1.  (U) On May 28, the Icelandic Parliament, the Althingi, passed a 
parliamentary resolution on the ratification of the Palermo Protocol 
to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime.  Iceland signed the Protocol 
in 2000 but ratification bogged down between the Ministry of Justice 
and the Althingi.  Text of the resolution follows para. 2. 
 
2.  (U) Text of the parliamentary resolution: 
Parliamentary resolution on the ratification of the Palermo Protocol 
against Transnational Organized Crime. 
 
The Althingi resolves to authorize the government to ratify on 
Iceland's behalf the Convention on Transnational Organized Crime 
that was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in New York 
on November 15, 2000. 
 
End text. 
 
3.  (U) Comment:  Iceland's long-overdue ratification of the Palermo 
Protocol answers a persistent complaint of activists and opposition 
parties, and brings the Government of Iceland into accord with 
international anti-TIP legislation.  Post expects that the protocol 
will be used as a basis for further government action on TIP and 
incorporated into the national action plan reported reftel.
