E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/13/2019 
TAGS:       
SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS: DUTCH SUPPORT ON GOLDSTONE REPORT 

REF: A. SECSTATE 106423 
B. THE HAGUE 582 

Classified By: POLECON Counselor Andrew C. Mann for reasons 1.5(b,d) 

1. (C) SUMMARY: The Dutch generally support the U.S. approach 
on the Goldstone report in New York and Geneva. The Dutch 
MFA hopes for additional information from the U.S. on next 
steps on the Goldstone report and on Middle East peace 
negotiations. There is a high-level political conflict 
between Development Minister Koenders and FM Verhagen on the 
Goldstone report. END SUMMARY. 

2. (C) SUPPORTING USG: Post shared reftel A points with MFA 
contacts on the Middle East, human rights, and NATO. MFA 
policy officers Dorine Wytema (Israel, Peace Process), 
Michael Thijssen (Palestine), and David Zeverijn (Israel) 
responded that the Dutch are on the same line, with little 
daylight between Dutch and American positions. In New York, 
the Dutch support a broad focus in New York on the progress 
of peace negotiations, rather than just a discussion of the 
Goldstone report. The Dutch are not certain whether they 
will intervene. However, the EU will make a statement which 
includes the assertion that debate over the Goldstone report 
belongs in Geneva. Zeverijn suggested that additional 
statements by EU members would sacrifice clarity and unity. 
In Geneva, the Dutch have not received definitive reporting 
on the EU strategy. However, they believe the Jerusalem 
element to the Palestinian draft resolution is inappropriate, 
and that that specific issue should be considered by UNESCO 
(for the cultural issues) and UNGA / UNSC (for the political 
issues). FM Verhagen, and possibly Development Minister 
Koenders, are reviewing the proposed instructions for the 
Dutch embassy in Geneva. Staff has advised FM Verhagen to 
vote no on the current draft resolution from the 
Palestinians, but the jury is still out as of October 15. 
(Note: Verhagen supports the U.S. approach and would probably 
support a no vote, but he must contend with Dutch coalition 
politics -- see paragraph 4. End Note.) 

3. (C) SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: MFA contacts would 
welcome further details on the U.S. strategy for action in 
the UN Third Committee or plenary 3ebate on the Goldstone 
report. The Dutch would also welcome an update on progress 
with the peace talks after Special Envoy Mitchell's recent 
visit. 

4. (C) DUTCH POLITICAL FRICTION OVER REPORT: Pieter De 
Gooijer, Director General for Political Affairs (P 
equivalent) told Charge on October 1 that Verhagen (of the 
Christian Democrat party) and Koenders (of the Labor party) 
had a major argument in New York over the Goldstone report. 
Verhagen had proposed a letter to the Dutch parliament 
finding fault with the report. According to De Gooijer, 
Verhagen believes we should tell Israel, you have friends, 
but you have to make concessions. Koenders, who wants to 
push Israel, went ballistic, prompting late-night 
mediation by PM Balkenende. Balkenende called in De Gooijer 
to draft compromise language for the letter. The letter 
defused the conflict in the Dutch parliament over Israel's 
conduct, allowing the Parliament to turn to the more 
controversial issue of Afghanistan. 
Qcontroversial issue of Afghanistan.
