Subject: (s) germany requests information concerning
iranian procurement of xxxxxxxxxxxx test chamber

Ref: a. 07 state 75839
b. State 15220
c. Berlin 195
d. State 40087
e. Berlin 511

Classified By: Glbal Affairs Unit Chief Don L. Brown for
reasons 14 (b) and (d).

1. (u) this is an action request. Please see para 5.

2. (S) On May 13, MFA Export Control Division Desk Officer
Wiebke Wacker provided Global Affairs Oficer with a
German-language nonpaper requesting nformation from U.S.
concerning an Iranian natioal, xxxxxxxxxxxx, in connection with the Iranian
procurement of a German origin environmental test chamber
from the firm xxxxxxxxxxxx. In support of a
current investigation, the Germans are specifically
interested in knowing whether the USG has any information
indicating that xxxxxxxxxxxx was aware that the Iranian
firm Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG) would be the
actual end-user of the environmental test chamber.

3. (S) In a May 5 meeting, Wacker provided Global Affairs
Officer with further background information concerning this
information request. According to the German Customs Office
of Criminal Investigation (Zollkriminalamt, or ZKA), Wacker
said, xxxxxxxxxxxx was confronted (and possibly detained)
by U.S. authorities in February 2008 while applying for a
visa at AmConGen Dubai. Wacker said the ZKA has assessed
that information concerning xxxxxxxxxxxx business contacts with
xxxxxxxxxxxx is a critical piece of evidence needed to
support the ZKA's ongoing investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx
and Iranian efforts to procure an environmental
chamber from xxxxxxxxxxxx.

4. (S) Begin informal Embassy translation of German-language
nonpaper:

With reference to the Non-Papers from June 1, 2007, August 3,
2007, December 18, 2007, February 15, 2008, and April 21,
2008 regarding the procurement of an environmental test
chamber by the Iranian xxxxxxxxxxxx from the German xxxxxxxxxxxx 
via Romania and Croatia, we take this opportunity
to ask the U.S. authorities about the following points:

The German export control authorities have learned that
xxxxxxxxxxxx was approached by U.S. authorities about
these matters. Because the German authorities have also
undertaken investigative measures, we are interested in
information concerning the results of these conversations.

The U.S. authorities reported in their Non Paper from April
21, 2008, that the Iranian firm SBIG is the actual intended
recipient of the test chamber. The German export control
authorities are accordingly interested in knowing whether the
German citizen xxxxxxxxxxxx had knowledge of this
end-user.

We thank you for the information in connection with the
SBIG's procurement attempts and we look forward to continuing
our excellent cooperation in the area of export controls.

End text of informal Embassy translation.

5. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests Department guidance
in responding to the questions posed in the German nonpaper.
