SUBJECT:  ICELAND IN NO RUSH TO ASSIST NEW PALESTINIAN 
AUTHORITY 
 
REF:  STATE 21256 
 
1. Post discussed reftel points with Icelandic MFA Head of 
International Institutions Division Nikulas Hannigan 
February 10.  Hannigan took note of U.S concerns about a new 
Palestinian Authority government that has not committed to 
non-violence, and he affirmed that Iceland generally 
supports the Quartet statements regarding Hamas.  He stated 
that while Iceland contributes to the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East 
(note:  to the tune of U.S. $45,000 in 2004, according to 
latest available UNRWA figures), it provides no bilateral 
aid to the Palestinians and has none planned.  He added 
that, as far as he knew, the Government of Iceland had no 
bilateral contacts with Palestinian representatives or 
delegations. 
 
2.  Referring to Middle Eastern protests in response to the 
Danish Mohammed cartoons, Hannigan remarked that, given the 
current "Nordic profile" in that region, he did not 
anticipate that Reykjavik would soon initiate aid to the 
Palestinian Authority. (Note:  An Icelandic newspaper 
reported last week that the honorary Icelandic consul in 
Amman had taken down the Icelandic flag outside her office 
for fear it could be mistaken for its Danish or Norwegian 
cousins. Another newspaper carried a column from an 
Icelandic journalist in Iran who reported that anti-cartoon 
demonstrators had told her that, had she been Danish, they 
would have killed her.)  Icelanders have reacted with 
bemusement and distaste to radical Islam's violent hijacking 
of what they believe should have been a debate about good 
taste and freedom of expression.
