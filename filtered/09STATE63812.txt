FROM NEA ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY JEFFREY
FELTMAN FOR CHARGE MILES 

I commend Embassy Ashgabat and in particular
Iran Watcher xxxxx, for its
excellent reporting on the Iranian elections.
Embassy insights were extremely useful for
their timeliness and for the helpful view
from "man on the street" Iranians.
Your second cable in particular
identified the interesting trend that
Mousavi was picking up votes from rural
voters. This excellent reporting provided
key insights to 7th floor principals and NEA.

Embassy reporting gave Washington recipients
an important view of working class Iranians' views on
the elections. Washington appreciates this reporting
that represents a key socioeconomic class from a variety
of geographic areas and ethnic groups -- a group
to which we might not otherwise have access.
By continuing and expanding your outreach,
you have provided an important
snapshot of the elections. This crucial information has
helped NEA and key principals in deciphering the
maze of Iranian electoral politics.

We look forward to further high quality reporting
from Embassy Ashgabat as we look to interpret
the election results and information you garner
from this key socioeconomic class and other contacts.

You have set a high standard for your colleagues
here in Washington and elsewhere.

Best,

Jeff
