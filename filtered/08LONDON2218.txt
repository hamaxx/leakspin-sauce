SUBJECT: UK PERSPECTIVE ON NATO MEDITERRANEAN DIALOGUE 
SOFA: "SOME COUNTRIES NEED A LEGALLY BINDING TREATY" REF: STATE 92323 

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard M. Mills, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) (C) HMG is fully aware of U.S. opposition to a proposed multilateral and reciprocal Mediterranean Dialogue SOFA, but apparently "some countries need a legally binding treaty for their constitutional purposes -- and there does not seem to be flexibility" on this point, Kevin Rooke, a member of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) NATO Team told Poloff August 29. Given that the FCO's lawyers have concluded that the positions of the U.S. and some other countries are "poles apart" on this matter, "perhaps the U.S. could have an Exchange of Letters while other countries agree to some sort of multilateral agreement along the lines of a SOFA," Rooke suggested. Such an arrangement would avoid a labyrinth of bilateral arrangements and, Rooke continued, the FCO's "legal experts say there is no legal block to the U.S. having its own agreements."
