Title- U.S.-Brazil: business on diplomacy

Op-ed in business oriented Valor Econtmico (8-10) states:
"....Brazil and U.S. keep old divergences, like the rustproof U.S.
tariff against the Brazilian ethanol and differences on trade
negotiations at the World Trade Organization. Now, the
U.S.-Colombia military deal, criticized in Brasilia, adds to the
list. But the political relations between the two governments are
doing well, and Washington is even trying to take trade advantages
of it.....Barack Obama's administration now promises advantages to
Brazil if it opts to buy Boeing's airplanes [on the Brazilian Air
Force bid to buy new fighter planes]...It is tempting, but the
Americans may have arrived too late. The incident with the
Supertucanos [when the U.S. blocked Brazil from selling the planes
to Venezuela] created a [level of] distrust where the U.S. could go
back on its word if there is a change in the administration there,
says a Brazilian minister. Nonetheless, on the political front the
effort at rapprochement from both sides is visible....."
