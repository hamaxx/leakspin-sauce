SUBJECT: UK RESPONSE TO ADDITION OF TWO NEW PARTNERS TO 
GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM  

REF: SECSTATE 80436  

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard M. Mills, Jr. for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  (C) Adding new partners to the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GI) is a positive development that could permit increased regional focus by GI members, Sharon McDonald, Desk Officer in the Counterproliferation Department at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, told us July 28 in response to reftel demarche regarding the addition of Mauritius and Uzbekistan as GI partners. McDonald emphasized the importance of regionally-focused efforts to combat nuclear terrorism, but also cautioned that a potential downside to increasing the number of partners is unwieldy plenary meetings.  Nonetheless, she continued, regional efforts are crucial and adding new members creates more opportunities for better regional cooperation.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXXTUTTLE
