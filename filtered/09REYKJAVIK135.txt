1. (SBU) Emboffs delivered points contained in reftel to Greta 
Gunnarsdottir, head of the International and Security Affairs 
Directorate at the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on August 
5.  Gunnarsdottir thanked Emboffs for the information and responded 
that the GOI intends to maintain its current level of support for 
the mission in Afghanistan. 
 
2. (SBU) Gunnarsdottir said that, due to the difficult economic 
situation in Iceland, the GOI is cutting back on many of its global 
peace keeping projects.  She offered assurances, however, that 
Afghanistan would remain a top priority for the Icelandic 
Government.  She also suggested that the seven or eight Icelanders 
who are currently serving in Afghanistan would remain in their 
positions for the foreseeable future.
