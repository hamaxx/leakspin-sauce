ENGAGEMENT PARTY FOR SALIM,S SON ATTRACTS GOU ELITE --------------------------------------------- ------ 

3. (S) The engagement party for Salim,s son, Sardor, was held in July 2005 at Salim,s mansion in Gazelkent near Tashkent. Following tradition, only women attended the engagement party. The close-knit group of around twenty guests included the wives of Interior Minister Matlybov, Justice Minister Mustafayev, Finance Minister Azimov, and Foreign Minister Ganiev, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Kasimov's sister. Salim,s daughters also attended, along with the wives of leading businessmen Muhiddin Jamol, "UzbekSavdo" chairman Zafar Faiyziev, and "UzbekComuneHizmet" General Director Halmukhamedov. 

4. (S) According to our contact, Salim did not attend the party, but provided each guest with a necklace worth $1,000. Jamol, a close friend of Salim's whose Alp Jamol conglomerate includes banks, supermarkets and shopping centers (ref C), was tasked with keeping the guests happy. The video shows Jamol handing out $100 bills to the guests as they dance. (Note: It is common in Uzbek culture for money to be given to women as they dance, and also to musicians. End note.)
