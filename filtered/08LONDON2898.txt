SUBJECT: HORN OF AFRICA PIRACY - HMG SHARES ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ON OPERATION ATALANTA; EU LIKELY TO REQUEST KENYAN PROSECUTION OF CAPTURED PIRATES  REF: BRUSSELS 1745  

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).  

1.  (C/NF)  FCO Deputy Head Security Policy Chris Holtby (strictly protect) confirmed that HMG is satisfied with the progress in establishment of Operational Headquarters (OHQ) in Northwood UK, and afloat Force Headquarters (FHQ) for the EU counter-piracy mission "Atalanta."  Holtby admitted that Greece had not been the UK's first choice for head of FHQ, but partitioning the year long mandate into three periods, with Spain and Holland in charge for the final two thirds of the operation, would ensure mission integrity and continuity.  The current schedule calls for the operational plan to be presented to EU Member States on November 25th, followed by mission launch on December 8th.  Holtby noted that this deployment will allow for an overlap with NATO operations in the waters off the Horn, which are scheduled to terminate on December 20.  Thus far the UK is satisfied with NATO/EU cooperation and coordination in the run-up to Atalanta.  

2.  (C/NF)  Holtby provided the following from the November 17/18 force generation conference: the goal is to have available six frigates plus maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) throughout the mission.  thus far; Greece - one frigate for 12 months; France - one frigate for 12 months plus MPA; Belgium - one frigate for third three month period; Sweden - two Corvettes plus support for 12 months; Germany - one frigate for 12 months; Spain - one frigate for second three month period plus MPA during the third period; UK - one frigate for the first and third three month periods; Holland - one frigate during the third three month period.  According to Holtby, Ukraine, Turkey and South Africa are non-EU states that have expressed interest in contributing, offers the EU will consider at a later date.  

3  (C/NF)  On the question of how to handle captured pirates, the UK will build upon the one-time agreement of the Kenyan government to prosecute eight suspects apprehended recently by the British Navy.  According to Holtby, this is a plan of action acceptable to most EU member states.  He added that an EU-wide MOU would likely utilize language similar to that in a diplomatic note (scanned copy sent to AF/RSA) HMG transmitted to the Republic of Kenya requesting that it "receive and prosecute prisoners taken in anti-piracy operations by the British Armed Forces" and that "international standards on human rights will be applied, including that those prisoners handed over to the Government of Kenya would not be subjected to the death penalty."  

4.  (C/NF)  To sweeten the deal for the Kenyans, the UK may participate in a program with the EU to provide technical or material support to the Kenyan judiciary, however nothing has been confirmed in that regard, according to FCO Kenya Desk Officer Sheena Lavery.  She added that the EU is also negotiating with Djibouti to accept captured pirates for prosecution.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
