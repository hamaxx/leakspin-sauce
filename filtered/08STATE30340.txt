1. (S/NF) This cable reports the results of a recent 
Washington review of reporting and collection needs for 
Paraguay.  The review produced a list of priorities 
(paragraph 5) intended to guide participating USG agencies as 
they allocate resources and update plans to collect 
information on Paraguay.  The priorities also serve as a 
useful tool to help the Embassy manage reporting and 
collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans 
(MSPs). 
 
2. (S/NF) Important information often is available to 
non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies 
participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection 
Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
Department channels. 
3. (S/NF) Please note that the community relies on State 
reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting by email 
and other means is vital to this effort.  When it is 
available, reporting officers should include as much of the 
following information as possible: office and organizational 
titles; names, position titles and other information on 
business cards; numbers of telephones, cell phones, pagers 
and faxes; compendia of contact information, such as 
telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic format 
if available) and e-mail listings; internet and intranet 
"handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site 
identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent 
flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant 
biographical information. 
 
4. (S/NF) This National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) is 
compliant with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework 
(NIPF), which was established in response to NSPD-26 of 
February 24, 2003.  If needed, GRPO can provide further 
background on the NIPF and the use of NIPF abbreviations 
(shown in parentheses following each sub-issue below) in
