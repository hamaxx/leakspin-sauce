1. (C/NF) WASHINGTON ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY 
INTERESTED IN MEXICO'S LEADERSHIP DYNAMICS, AND WE HAVE 
APPRECIATED POST'S COVERAGE OF THIS TOPIC, REFS A-E HAVE 
SPECIFICALLY BEEN USEFUL TO GAUGE INSIGHT INTO THESE 
DYNAMICS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN REVISITING OUR ASSESSMENT OF 
MEXICAN PRESIDENT CALDERON TO BETTER INFORM US POLICYMAKERS 
ON HIS LEADERSHIP STYLE. REFS F-H HAVE INDICATED THAT 
CALDERON AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE CURRENTLY UNDER GREAT 
STRESS FROM THE DRUG WAR, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE, AND HIS PARTY'S 
MIDTERM ELECTION LOSSES. DESPITE RECENT REPORTING WE ARE 
STILL INTERESTED IN HOW THESE CURRENT STRESSES ARE AFFECTING 
HIS PERSONALITY AND MANAGEMENT STYLE AND HOW THAT STYLE IS 
AFFECTING THE RUNNING OF THE GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT 
OF RECENT CABINET CHANGES. IN THE COURSE OF POST'S REGULAR 
MEETINGS, WE WOULD WELCOME ANY INSIGHT POST CAN PROVIDE ON 
THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. 

A. (U) PRESIDENT CALDERON 

1) (C/NF) HOW DOES PRESIDENT CALDERON REACT TO VIEWPOINTS 
THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN? (DOES HE LIKE TO GET INTO 
DEBATES WITH PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIM? DOES HE PREFER TO 
LISTEN TO THEIR VIEWPOINT, THINK ON IT FOR A WHILE, AND COME 
BACK WITH A RESPONSE?) DOES HE SURROUND HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE A VARIETY OF VIEWPOINTS, OR DOES HE PREFER "YES MEN"? 

2) (C/NF) HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CALDERON'S MANAGEMENT 
STYLE (MORE OF AN "IDEA MAN" OR MORE OF A "MICROMANAGER")? 
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF HIS MANAGEMENT STYLE ON THOSE WHO 
WORK FOR HIM? 

3) (C/NF) HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE CALDERON'S PERSONALITY? 
WHAT VALUES/BELIEFS/BEHAVIORS DOES CALDERON HOLD MOST DEARLY, 
AND RESPECT MOST IN OTHERS (TRUTHFULNESS, LOYALTY, RESPECT, 
ETC)? 

4) (C/NF) WHAT ARE CALDERON'S PLANS' FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
HIS TERM? (SECURITY, ECONOMY, PAN PARTY, DEALING WITH THE 
PRI)? 

B. (U) CABINET 

1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR PRESIDENT CALDERON'S 
SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECTIONS OF HIS CABINET DURING THEIR 
REMAINING TIME IN OFFICE? HOW DO THEY PLAN ON ACHIEVING THOSE 
GOALS? 

2) (C/NF) HOW DO THEY INDIVIDUALLY VIEW THE UNITED STATES, 
AND HOW STRONG IS THEIR WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH US 
OFFICIALS? 

3) (C/NF) WHAT IS THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP STATUS OF 
PRESIDENT CALDERON'S CABINET? DO ALL MEMBERS GET ALONG? HAVE 
RIVALRIES, FRIENDSHIPS BEEN FORMED? HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS 
TRICKLED DOWN TO THE WORKING LEVEL STAFFS OF EACH CABINET 
MEMBER,S OFFICE? 

4) (C/NF) HAS JOB STRESS AFFECTED ANY OF THE SECURITY AND 
ECONOMIC SECTIONS OF HIS CABINET MEMBERS, HEALTH? IF SO, 
HOW? WHAT ARE SOME WAYS THESE MEMBERS ARE ADDRESSING THIS 
STRESS? 

2. (U) PLEASE CITE C-AL9-02352 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
