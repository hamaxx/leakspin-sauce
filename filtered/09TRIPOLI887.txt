1. (C) Post met with Abdurouf Bakir, Chairman and Owner of Al-Masar Stock Company for Selling Aircraft Equipment on October 25, 2009. Below are the answers to questions posed in reftel: --This entity is in the business of brokering defense articles and defense services at the location indicated under its legal name. --This entity is authorized to conduct such activities in Libya. Post does not have any criminal or derogatory background information on this entity or individual. --Al-Masar Stock Company will not be handling or storing United States Munitions List (USML) items on behalf of its clients. The client handles its incoming shipments and takes care of all shipping formalities and storage of goods. --Al-Masar Stock Company was established in August 2007. It has 10 principal share-holders, of whom four are employees running the company: Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Commercial Manager, and Title Member of the Board Share-holder. --Al-Masar deals in the Aviation sector, procuring for civilian airlines, and also for the Libyan military (Air Force). Clients include the Libyan government as well as private companies. Bakir estimates 30 to 40 percent of their business is with the Libyan Air Force, working through the Military Procurement Office. All clients are located in Libya and are Libyan. Al-Masar represents several companies in Europe as well as in the U.S. (Rockwell Collins, based in Cedar Rapids, IA, and DIRCO (Milwaukee, WI). --The company understands the restrictions on USML items.

2. (C) Comment: Bakir appears to be a competent broker, with relevant prior experience as an engineer in the Aviation industry. He noted his company is a member of TRACE, International (an organization that promotes transparency and good governance in business), and is the only member of this organization in Libya. Emboff had the impression he works mainly as a consultant as his company has no real physical office. Bakir works out of his residence. End comment. CRETZ
