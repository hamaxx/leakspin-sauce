1.(C) The two Swiss who were taken into Libyan custody in late September were released to the Swiss Embassy on November 9, without explanation. Swiss Charge Stefano Lazzarotto told Pol/Econ Chief that whether the Swiss will be allowed to depart the country is still an open question. They are in good health, "as good as can be expected under the circumstances," according to a Swiss Government press statement. Lazzarotto thanked the USG and the Ambassador for urging the GOL to release the individuals.

2.(C) Comment: In recent weeks, the Swiss have requested the assistance of a number of third countries, including the USG, the French, and the European Union, to urge the GOL to release the individuals. EU and USG intervention with GOL officials likely contributed to the release. While the news is positive, the situation will not be resolved until the GOL agrees to allow the Swiss to depart. The countries also face the broader question of normalization of relations in the wake of this high-profile and highly sensitive conflict. Post will report further details via septel. CRETZ
