REF: TRIPOLI 115

1.(SBU) This is an action request; please see para 4.

2.(SBU) On February 15, 2010, the Embassy received a diplomatic note from the International Organizations Office at the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (Ministry of Foreign Affairs equivalent), formally requesting U.S. support for Libya's upcoming bid for full Missile Technology Control Regime membership. Full text of the diplomatic note is included at para 5.

3.(SBU) The diplomatic note inaccurately claimed that the Ambassador had already committed to support Libya's candidacy. In response, the Embassy sent a diplomatic note to the MFA on February 23, refuting the statement and explaining that the Embassy would refer the overall matter of USG support for Libya's bid to the Department.

4.(SBU) The Embassy requests Department guidance on replying to the GOL on this issue.

5.(SBU) Informal Embassy translation of Libyan diplomatic note number 341/38/1/35, which was forwarded by e-mail to NEA/MAG on February 15: The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (International Organizations Office) sends its compliments to the U.S. Embassy in the Great Jamahiriya. Further to the meeting held on February 9, 2010 at the Command and Staff School in Libya between the Libyan side represented by the head of the Technical Cooperation Department and the National Committees at the Defense Interim Committee, and the American side represented by H.E. the U.S. Ambassador accredited to Great Jamhiriya, this office would like to note that among the topics referred to was Libya's recurrent request to join MTCR as a member, and H.E. the U.S. Ambassador promised to support Libya to accede to such membership. Therefore, we would like hereby to request your country's support to Libya during the next meeting of the MTCR forum expected to convene this year. The General People's Committee Secretariat for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (International Organizations Office) avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed U.S. Embassy the assurances of its highest considerations. (Seal of the General People's Secretary for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation) To: U.S. Embassy - Tripoli Date: February 14, 2010 POLASCHIK
