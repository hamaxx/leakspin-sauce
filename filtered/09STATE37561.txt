SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: AFRICAN GREAT 
LAKES (DROC, BURUNDI, RWANDA) 
 
REF: A. 08 KIGALI 00830--05/DEC/2008 
     B. 08 STATE 122706--19/NOV/2008 
     C. 04 STATE 101403--06/MAY/2004 
 
Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS,  REASON: 1.4(C). 
 
1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new 
National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on African Great 
Lakes (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued 
DOS reporting of biographic information relating to DROC, 
Burundi, and Rwanda (paragraph 2). 
 
A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supersedes the NHCD contained in Ref 
C and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of 
reporting and collection needs announced in Ref B focused on 
African Great Lakes.  The review produced a comprehensive 
list of strategic priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and 
collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide 
participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
update plans to collect information on African Great Lakes. 
We thank Kigali for its Ref A input.  The priorities should 
also serve as a useful tool to help the Embassy manage 
reporting and collection, including formulation of Mission 
Strategic Plans (MSPs). 
 
B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
 
C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to 
non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies 
participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection 
Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
Department channels.  We appreciate Ref A response from 
Kigali. 
 
2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting: 
 
A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
and other means is vital to the community's collection 
efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
dissemination to the IC. 
 
B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the 
following information as possible when they have information 
relating to persons linked to African Great Lakes: office and 
organizational titles; names, position titles and other 
information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell 
phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information, 
such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic 
format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and 
intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site 
identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent 
flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant 
biographical information.
