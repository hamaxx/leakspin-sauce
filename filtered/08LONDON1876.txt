SUBJECT: UK WELCOMES U.S. MESSAGE ON VIGILANCE OF IRISL CARGOES; BACKS TOUGHER EU ACTION  REF: A. STATE 69339      

B. PARIS 1291  Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, Jr. for reasons 1.4 ( b) and (d).  

1. (S) The UK Government welcomed the U.S. message urging increased vigilance of ships and cargoes belonging to Iran Air Cargo and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and is advising relevant companies in the UK-based shipping industry of the need for due diligence when engaged with either entity.  Isabella McRae, Deputy Head of the Foreign Office's Non-Proliferation Department, provided Poloff with HMG response to ref A demarche on July 16.   The UK Government appreciated the information on IRISL deceptive practices, and on previous interdictions of IRISL cargo, much of which was known to HMG.  McRae said that UK Customs and Treasury had advised "key components" of the UK shipping industry of the need for extra vigilance of IRISL-related transports, although she could not specify what steps, if any, the UK Treasury had taken to monitor financial activities related to IRISL.  McRae said the U.S. demarche was valuable in reminding other governments as well to take action and HMG welcomed the U.S. initiative.   Poloff emphasized that the message and non-paper were provided in the framework of the Proliferation Security Initiative; McRae acknowledged that as a PSI participant, the UK had an additional obligation to respond to requirements of UNSCR 1803 regarding IRISL.  

2. (S) McRae added that the UK government supports on-going efforts in the EU, led by France, to strengthen restrictions on Iran Air Cargo and IRISL.  McRae did not know all the specifics of what was under discussion in the EU, but said the UK agreed with the French proposal to require mandatory declarations by port authorities whenever an Iran Air plane or IRISL ship arrived or departed (see Ref B).  McRae said that opposition to tighter controls came from the "island Members" of the EU -- Cyprus and Malta.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX TUTTLE
