SUBJECT: PERSONAL PROTECTION REQUEST FOR SPANISH
ANTI-TERRORISM JUDGE D. BALTASAR GARZON REAL

1. (SBU) RSO has received a letter from the Spanish Ministry
of Interior, Secretary of State for Security, requesting that
the Diplomatic Security Service provide protective security
services for Spanish Anti-Terrorism Judge Baltasar Garzon.
Judge Garzon will be a long-term guest lecturer at New York
University's King Juan Carlos Center for nine months from
February 28, 2005 until December 01, 2005. His classes will
deal with terrorism and national security issues.

2. (SBU) Judge Garzon is considered a critical threat
profile Judge due to his on-going oversight and involvement
in highly-visible terrorism cases including the September 11,
2001 Trade Tower bombings as connected to the Moroccan
Al-Qaida cell known as the Barakat Yarkas group.

3. (SBU) In the letter received, the Spanish Secretary of
State for Security highlights what they consider to be the
risks and considerations that come with the public exposure
of Judge Garzon's work in New York City and requests a
permanent security presence for him. The GOS is committed to
provide two armed Spanish Police to Judge Garzon full time
but believe that a U.S. law enforcement presence is essential
for coordination and effectiveness.

4. (SBU) In discussions on February 11 with the Spanish
Police Chief for Protective Service, Angel Quintana, the RSO
explained that due to extreme demand on DSS manpower, it was
unlikely that 2 DSS Agents could be provided full time, and
that it was also unlikely that even a single agent could be
dedicated for nine months to this detail. The RSO opined
that the more likely scenario would be an accessible agent
for coordination, communication and problem solving out of DP
or PL.

5. (SBU) Due to the limited planning time (February 28
departure), RSO requests urgent consideration be given to
this request with a rapid response to the RSO for the Spanish
Protective Police travel and visa requirement planning,
keeping the Spanish Embassy in Washington and the Spanish
Consulate in New York in the loop.
