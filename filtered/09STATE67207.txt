-- We are looking forward to the Plenary meeting of the Australia Group (AG) in Paris, September 21-25. The Plenary presents AG participants with an opportunity to exchange information on issues related to chemical and biological weapons (CBW) proliferation that would benefit AG participants' implementation of export controls on CBW-related goods and technology.

-- In this regard, we welcome the full and active participation of your country's delegation in the AG Plenary's Information Exchange and Enforcement Experts meetings.

-- In the Information Exchange, we believe it is important to focus on emerging chemical and biological technologies, trends in the trade of CBW-related goods and threats (including threats from a regional perspective). We encourage participants to circulate any papers for the Information Exchange at least one week in advance of the Plenary so that AG participants can prepare for discussions at the exchange.

-- The United States believes there is general interest among AG participants for any information you can share related to Russia in light of its continued interest in AG membership. This request is being made to all AG participants. We believe the following information would be particularly helpful to reaching consensus: - Your assessment of the effectiveness of Russia's export controls, particularly on CBW-related technology. - Any information you can share on the current state of Russia's CBW-related programs.

-- For the Enforcement Experts Meeting, we encourage participants to include hands-on enforcement/customs officials in their delegations and to continue offering case studies of recent or past enforcement actions.
