SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: ANTI-ISRAEL RESOLUTIONS AT 
UNGA 
 
REF: STATE 123081 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Stephen Liston for REASONS 1.4 B AND D. 

1. (C) On Tuesday, November 25, poloff delivered reftel demarche to Secretario Ricardo Rizzo from the United Nations Division of the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations. Rizzo sincerely thanked poloff for the detailed information breaking down the number of anti-Israeli resolutions compared to other countries and added that, although he was aware that there was a disproportionate level of anti-Israeli discourse at the U.N., he never realized its extent until looking at the figures. Furthermore, he noted that he was unaware of the continuing existence of the three U.N. bodies charged with protecting Palestinian rights or monitoring Israeli practices and candidly admitted that it showed a "lack of maturity" in the international system that would have to be overcome in order to achieve progress towards peace in the region. He noted, however, that he could only take the points presented under advisement for the moment and that he would have to consult with the regional desks involved with the issue in order to provide a reaction to the demarche points. Post will monitor and report any further reaction.
