SIPDIS 

E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/23/2019 
TAGS:       
SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/HRC: SUPPORTING U.S. ON GOLDSTONE 
REPORT 

REF: SECSTATE 98567 

Classified By: POLECON Counselor Andrew C. Mann for reasons 1.5 (b,d) 

1. (C) SUMMARY: The Dutch MFA supports the U.S. position on 
the Goldstone report, but some members in the Dutch 
Parliament will try to pressure FM Verhagen to take a more 
skeptical approach toward Israel. The MFA intimated there is 
a split on Israel policy between FM Verhagen and Development 
Minister Koenders. END SUMMARY. 

2. (C) Post delivered reftel points to key MFA contacts, and 
the PolEcon Counselor and Pol Deputy met September 24 with 
Mr. Henne Schuwer, newly arrived Director of the North Africa 
and Middle East Department. Schuwer stated we're in the 
same place. The Dutch want to maintain the Human Rights 
Council (HRC) focus on the report, rather than referring it 
to New York. We should let the parties comment on the 
report, said Schuwer, we don't need to rush. Schuwer further 
agreed that the mandate of the report was flawed, and that 
the report is too focused on Israel. Nonetheless, it was 
clever to pick Goldstone, given his stature. Because it's 
a serious report, we will need to respond. The Dutch had 
encouraged the Israelis to participate in the process with 
the aim of producing a better final product. The Dutch will 
encourage the EU to keep debate on the report at the HRC, but 
Schuwer did not anticipate the EU could reach consensus on 
this. 

3. (C) When the Goldstone report was first released, FM 
Verhagen publicly stated that it was one-sided, with too much 
focus on Israel. Schuwer noted the FM may have spoken a bit 
Qfocus on Israel. Schuwer noted the FM may have spoken a bit 
soon, and Verhagen sent a letter to Parliament on September 
21 that it was too soon to offer an assessment. Responding 
to subsequent criticism from Parliament, Verhagen agreed to 
submit the MFA's position to Parliament on September 28. 
Parliament will then debate the issue the next day. Schuwer 
acknowledged that we won't be able to hide the split on 
Israel policy. (Note/Comment: Verhagen and his party, the 
Christian Democrats (CDA), have traditionally defended 
Israel. Minister for Development Cooperation Koenders and 
his Labor Party are more skeptical of Israel's commitment to 
human rights. In sharp debates over Israel's human rights 
policies, the CDA is challenged by Labor and other parties on

the left. Post does not expect next week's debate to change 
the Dutch approach in the HRC as described by Schuwer in 
paragraph 2. End Note/Comment.)
