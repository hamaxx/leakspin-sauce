SUBJECT:  REYKJAVIK OIG COMPLIANCE UPDATE/REQUEST FOR EXTENSION 
 
REF: A. STATE 2995, B. STATE 085363, C. SIO-I-03-61 
 
1. (SBU) Post is committed to closing Recommendation 2 in the OIG's 
2003 report (ref c) as soon as possible.  Post continues to advise 
the OIG on the status of the Perimeter Security Upgrade Project in 
line with Recommendation 2 in ref c.  As previously reported, Post 
has been denied a permit by the city of Reykjavik to build on the 
property because of opposition by the neighbors in the vicinity of 
the Mission. 
 
2.  (SBU) Post is still awaiting the appointment of a Chief of 
Mission, a process that has delayed a final decision on the 
construction project.  Due to an anticipated arrival of a new COM 
sometime in spring 2010, Post requests an extension on the final 
decision on the project until July 2010.  This extension should 
allow the incoming COM enough time to fully examine this complex 
issue and make a determination on how to proceed. 
 
3.  (SBU) POC is Marco A. Fernandez, RSO.
