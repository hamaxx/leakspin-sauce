TAGS:    
SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: MARCH UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL SESSION 
PRIORITIES 
 
REF: 10 STATE 16236; 10 TEL AVIV 432 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Stephen O'Dowd, Counselor, State, ECPO; REASON: 
1.4(B), (D) 
 
1. (C) On February 23, we delivered ref A demarche to MFA Deputy 
Director for Human Rights Omar Shalaby.  On defamation of 
religions, Shalaby said Egypt would support the OIC position.  He 
believed there is currently no broad backing for a binding treaty. 
On Guinea, Shalaby said Nigeria would take the lead, and committed 
to discussing the issue with the Nigerian government.  On the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, he told us Egypt favors a 
thematic mandate.  According to Shalaby, Egypt believes that the 
previous special procedures mandate was not effective, and the 
Africa Group would continue to maintain this position.  On Iran, 
Shalaby said Egypt would not support a resolution, consistent with 
its policy of opposing country specific resolutions.  He noted that 
the GOE would accept discussion of the situation in Iran at the 
March session.  On DPRK and Burma, Shalaby told us Egypt would 
support the positions of the two states concerned.  He said Egypt 
would back special rapporteurs if the DPRK and Burma agreed. 
 
 
 
2. (C) On the Goldstone Report, Shalaby said the GOE is considering 
how to pursue the issue.  He noted GOE concern that the Israeli 
Government's February 21 announcement of a plan to preserve and 
rehabilitate "national heritage sites" included the Tomb of the 
Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem (ref B). 
Shalaby thought the GOE might seek action on this issue at the 
March session.  (Note:  On February 22, the MFA issued a statement 
"strongly condemning...the Israeli government's decision to enlist 
the Ibrahimi mosque and Belal Mosque on the Israeli national 
heritage list."  The statement "described this decision as illegal 
since Israel is an occupation force in the West Bank."  End note.) 
 
 
 
3. (C) Shalaby said Egypt would focus on Israeli-Palestinian 
issues, African issues, defamation of religions, and racism at the 
March session.  He noted that the GOE has not planned any specific 
initiatives.
