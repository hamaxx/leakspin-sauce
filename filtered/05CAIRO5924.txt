SUBJECT: EGYPTIAN GTMO DETAINEES - STATUS OF DISCUSSIONS 

REF: CAIRO 5589 AND PREVIOUS 

Classified By: CHARGE STUART E.JONES, REASONS 1.5 B AND D 

1. (S) SUMMARY: In the context of the close and sustained 
cooperation between the USG and GOE on counterterrorism, Post 
believes that the written GOE assurances regarding the return 
of three Egyptians detained at Guantanamo (reftel) represent 
the firm commitment of the GOE to adhere to the requested 
principles. These assurances were passed directly from 
Egyptian General Intelligence Service (EGIS) Chief Soliman 
through liaison channels -- the most effective communication 
path on this issue. General Soliman's word is the GOE's 
guarantee, and the GOE's track record of cooperation on CT 
issues lends further support to this assessment. End summary. 


EGYPTIAN ASSURANCES 
------------------- 

2. (S) As stated in reftel, Post has received written 
assurances from the Egyptian General Intelligence Service 
(EGIS) regarding the acceptance and humane treatment of three 
Egyptians currently detained in Guantanamo: 

-- Abdul Rahman Mohammed AL-MARZOUQ, ISN US9EG-00369DP; 

-- Allah Muhammad SALEEM, ISN US9EG-00071DP; 

-- Sami Abdul Aziz Salim ALLAITHY, ISN US9EG-000287DP. 

Post believes that these assurances represent a firm 
commitment by the GOE to handle the matter in accordance with 
our stated principles. We recommend that the interagency 
consider approving transfer now on the basis of these 
assurances. 


DIRECT CHANNEL 
-------------- 

3. (S) Post has established that the most effective conduit 
for addressing this issue is through Cairo Station - EGIS 
Liaison. The written assurances (reftel) were passed directly 
from EGIS Chief General Soliman through this channel. 
General Soliman's stature and power in the Egyptian 
establishment, and his history of close cooperation with the 
USG on counterterrorism, corroborate the Egyptian intent take 
responsibility for the detainees in such a way that protects 
both U.S. and Egyptian security interests. In addition to 
the written assurances regarding the detainees treatment, 
EGIS has conveyed orally to Cairo station that all three will 
be taken into custody upon arrival in Egypt and will be 
investigated and prosecuted in accordance with Egyptian law. 

4. (S) We understand the need for specific language on this 
matter. However, the danger of seeking specificity beyond 
what we have already received in EGIS' written assurances is 
that EGIS may decide to turn the case over to the MFA. MFA 
involvement will complicate the process and delay disposal of 
the cases.
