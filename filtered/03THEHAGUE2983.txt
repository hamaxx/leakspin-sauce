(C): PolOff delivered reftel points to Dutch MFA Director of 
UN Political and Judicial Affairs Pieter Ramaer on November 
28. Ramaer said the EU cannot technically oppose the 
convening of an Emergency Special Session of the General 
Assembly, apart from conveying that the session is not 
timely. Ramaer said he cannot imagine the EU will go 
along with the Palestinian challenge to Israeli credentials. 
Personally speaking, he said the challenge to Israeli 
credentials doesn't stand a chance, and is just a mechanism 
to draw attention to Palestinian and Arab frustration. 
Regarding the request to seek an International Court of 
Justice (ICJ) opinion on the legality of the Israeli 
separation barrier, Ramaer noted the Dutch are not 
enthusiastic about the ICJ and agree with the U.S. that 
bringing ICJ into the peace process will only complicate 
matters. He said he cannot yet predict what the EU will do 
if in fact the ICJ resolution comes to a vote, but made it 
clear there is a preference for keeping the ICJ out of the 
Middle East Peace Process. Ramaer said he agrees with the 
U.S. points regarding the Committee on the Exercise of the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, but thinks the 
EU consensus will be for abstention with an explanatory vote 
like last year. He asked for more time to check with his MFA 
and New York colleagues about the Division of Palestinian 
Rights, agreeing to contact PolOff on Monday with any further 
information.
