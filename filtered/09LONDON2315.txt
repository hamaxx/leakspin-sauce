SUBJECT: UK THINKING ON OCTOBER 9 DISCUSSION WITH AUNG SAN 
SUU KYI ON SANCTIONS  REF: A. RANGOON 687      B. STATE 100518  Classified By: Political Counselor Robin Quinville, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

1. (C) UK Foreign Office Burma Team deputy leader Gill Lever told poloff October 8 that the key message the UK Government wants to get across during the October 9 meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) about sanctions is that sanctions are "not all or nothing" and can be done in a gradual way based on the Government of Burma's (GOB) response.  Lever said the UK Government sees this as the key point because the GOB has tried to make it appear as if sanctions are "all or nothing."  The UK plans to put together a packet of papers on the UK and common EU position, while understanding that the GOB may not allow it to be passed to ASSK.  The packet will contain recent EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) statements and the UK's recent statement to the Friends of Burma group, all of which is in the public domain.  Lever said the UK Government does not want to draw ASSK into a position on sanctions, which could potentially confirm the GOB's worst fears about her, but they do want her to understand the approach.  With GOB terming the meeting a "gesture of goodwill," Lever said the UK supports a "balanced approach," as to not prejudice any future meetings and to demonstrate the international community is a good interlocutor.  Lever expressed appreciation for the excellent cooperation between the U.S. and UK missions in Rangoon.  

2. (SBU) Post delivered reftel B demarche.  Lever expressed appreciation for the additional information on the USG's policy review and underscored the UK's support for the common EU position.    Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
