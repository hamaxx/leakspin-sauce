E.O. 12958: DECL: 10/28/2014 
TAGS:    
SUBJECT: AVIATION SECURITY: DIALOGUE BETWEEN USG AND BRAZIL ON SUPPLYING PASSENGER NAME RECORD DATA Classified By: DCM Phillip Chicola Based upon Reason 1.4(B) and (D) 

1. (C) Based upon ongoing discussions between AmEmbassy Brasilia DHS Attache and officials at the GOB Civil Aviation Authority (DAC), post requests that Department approach DHS to suggest that the US and the GOB commence talks on the how Brazilian carriers supply the USG with Passenger Name Record Data for flights destined to the U.S. While previously, citing legal restrictions, Varig (Brazil's principal overseas carrier) had declined to supply the USG with such data, consultations recently undertaken have indicated that there is now a greater willingness on the Brazilian side to find a way to provide the needed information. 

2. (C) Whatever understanding is reached, it will likely need to be memorialized in a written agreement between DHS and the DAC. We think it advisable that Department formally contact DHS's Customs and Border Protection officials asap to suggest that it initiate such talks. If necessary, post would welcome the travel of an interagency USG team to Brazil to discuss the issue with the DAC. Embassy Point of Contact on this issue is Econ Counselor Bruce Williamson.
