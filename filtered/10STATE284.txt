C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 STATE 000284 SIPDIS E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/04/2020 TAGS:      

1.(U) This is an action request; see para 5.

2.(C) The United States and Libya have an opportunity to strengthen the bilateral relationship by establishing a regular political-military dialogue, especially in light of their recent signing of a 505 agreement (ref a). Furthermore, the Department concurs with Post's suggestion to establish an inaugural pol-mil dialogue in early 2010 (ref b), and supports doing so as early as the January-February 2010 timeframe. These discussions should focus on building trust on issues such as regional security, defense capabilities and needs, end use monitoring, and broader security cooperation issues (proposed agenda themes in para 5). It should be made clear that Libyan participation in this dialogue is not transactional in nature, but the goal is to establish a more effective channel for an effective security-related dialogue between the USG and GOL.

3.(C) Given the sensitivity of the bilateral relationship at this time (stemming in particular from the Libyan welcome to Pan Am 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi,the human rights case of Fathi al-Jahmi, balking on WMD commitments) and GOL unfamiliarity with the mechanics and intent of pol-mil talks with the USG, the Department proposes that Post engage with the GOL to establish a date for the inaugural pol-mil talks.

4.(C) The Department envisions that the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs lead the pol-mil talks with appropriate participation by NEA, DOD/OSD, DOD/Joint Staff, AFRICOM, the NSC, and other interagency partners. The timing of inaugural talks will be the subject of close cooperation with Post, NEA, DOD and the NSC. These talks are separate from, and broader in scope than, the military to military "Council of Colonels" discussion (to be held January 11-13).

5.(C/REL LIBYA) Action Request: Post is requested to draw upon the U.S.-proposed agenda items below, and elicit GOL proposals to develop the timing and substance of the pol-mil dialogue. Post is also requested to begin discussions on the desired composition of delegations, timing, location, and other related matters. Regarding post's input for agenda items in reftel B, the Department views discussion of Libya's fulfillment of its Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) (SCUD-B destruction) commitments as better suited for established channels with officials from the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. We also consider discussion of the disposition of Libya's efforts to take delivery of the C-130s located in Marietta, Georgia as an "if raised" topic only for this forum, as the USG has told the GOL repeatedly to address any concerns about these aircraft directly with Lockheed Martin. SECURITY COOPERATION - USG pol-mil talks globally: history, models and outcomes (U.S.) - Expanding cooperation in demining and combating MANPADS - (U.S.) - Requirements for the protection of U.S. military technology - (e.g., the 505 Agreement, a budget transparency waiver, and opportunities available to Libya now that they have signed the 505 Agreement) (U.S.) DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AND COOPERATION - Resource/security requirements overview - (Libya) - Strengthening defense trade via Foreign Military Sales - (U.S.) - Libya's defense procurement status - (U.S.) REGIONAL SECURITY - Regional security overview and strategic priorities - (U.S. and Libya) a.
