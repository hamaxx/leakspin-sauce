SUBJECT: RUSSIAN NATO AMBASSADOR DECRIES "TREACHEROUS" GEORGIAN USE OF FORCE

1. (SBU) Late on the afternoon of August 8, the Russian Mission distributed a letter addressed to Deputy Secretary General Bisogniero on the unfolding crisis in Georgia. 

2. (SBU) The text of the letter is as follows: Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to NATO Brussels, 8 August 2008 Dr. Mr. C. Bisogniero, We would like to draw your attention to grim and alarming realities of the situation in South Ossetia. On the night of August 7-8, just several hours after the agreement had been reached to hold talks to settle the new round of the South Ossetia conflict Georgian military units undertook a treacherous, massive attack on Tskhinvali. A use-of-force scenario was resorted to by the Georgian leadership, despite all the diplomatic efforts that had been undertaken in contacts among Moscow, Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, Washington and other concerned capitals. The fighting is going on, the number of civilian victims in South Ossetia is sharply rising. The Russian peacekeepers were also attacked by the Georgian forces, several were killed, three wounded. The credibility of the Georgian leadership as a responsible participant of the negotiation process and of the international intercourse corresponding to the principles of the United Nations Charter in general has been completely undermined as a result. The Russian Federation will continue its efforts directed at preventing any further bloodshed and at getting the situation in South Ossetia back into its peaceful course. We kindly ask you to make the substance of this note known to the NRC and partner countries. Sincerely yours, signed D. Rogozin H.E. Mr. Claudio BISOGNIERO Deputy NATO Secretary General North Atlantic Treaty Organization Brussels, Belgium
