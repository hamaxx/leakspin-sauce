1.(S) Global Affairs officer delivered ref A demarche February 19 to MFA Export Control Division Deputy Director Markus Klinger. Klinger said German officials would factor U.S. recommendations into their planning for the 2008 Information Exchange and Enforcement Experts meetings. He noted that German officials made a presentation on Iran's CBW program at the 2007 Information Exchange and said Germany is willing to consider making a follow-up presentation this year. Klinger said Germany looks forward to a further exchange of views on the effectiveness of Russia's export controls and on the current state of Russia's CBW-related programs (ref B).

2.(C) Klinger noted that it is standard practice for at least one representative of the German Federal Office of Customs Investigation (Zollkriminalamt, or ZKA) to attend the Enforcement Experts meeting. Klinger said Germany will consider sharing updates on case studies presented by ZKA personnel at the 2007 meeting.

3.(SBU) Klinger also said Germany will continue to push for adoption of its proposals on intangible technology. He reported that experts in the German Federal Office of Economics and Export Controls (BAFA) are in the final stages of preparing a response to U.S. comments (ref C and previous) on the German proposals.
