Summary. 

--------------------------------------------- -- 
Coordination on G-20 and Summit of the Americas 
--------------------------------------------- -- 

4. (C) Following on a suggestion of both Presidents during 
their March 14 meeting, Patriota proposed the Secretary and 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim meet to discuss Summit of 
the Americas outcomes on April 1 or 2 just prior to the G-20 
summit in London. He noted the Brazilian G-20 sherpa met 
with his U.S. counterpart in Washington on March 16, and will 
return shortly to meet with Treasury Department officials. 
Steinberg described the U.S. ambition to bring a strong human 
dimension to the Summit of the Americas by keeping the focus 
on issues like addressing inequality and poverty. 

--------------------------- 
EPA Rule-making on Biofuels 
--------------------------- 

5. (C) Brazil is concerned an EPA draft rule on the 
classification of Brazilian ethanol will sharply curtail 
trade in biofuels and deal a severe political blow to our 
bilateral biofuels cooperation. The GOB believes the EPA 
process is politically motivated, and would like an 
opportunity for Brazilian scientists to present 
counter-arguments.

Venezuela, Haiti

6. (C) Following on a request POTUS made of President Lula 
during their March 14 meeting, Patriota said the Government 
of Brazil had approached Caracas on Venezuelan reticence to 
grant visas for U.S. diplomats. Without providing specifics, 
Patriota indicated "there seems to be cause for some 
optimism" on the subject. Turning to Haiti, Patriota 
indicated the GOB is eager coordinate with WHA ahead of the 
April Haiti Donors' Conference in mid-April. Steinberg noted 
the our interest in improving the situation in Haiti, and 
welcomed Brazil's engagement. 

-------------------------- 
Other High-Level Dialogues 
-------------------------- 

7. (C) The Government of Brazil has named a new U/S for 
Political Affairs (Note: Vera Machado), and Patriota asked 
that we resume our P-level strategic dialogue as soon as 
possible. The GOB also want to resume our Assistant 
Secretary-level dialogues on Africa and Middle East, when 
appropriate personnel are in place. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Samuel Guimaraes, who has not visited the United States 
during his six years in the number two position in the 
foreign ministry, has asked to meet with Deputy Secretary 
Steinberg, which the Deputy welcomed.
