SUBJECT: UK RESPONSE: APPROACH TO 2010 NPT REVIEW CONFERENCE REF: SECSTATE 126209

1.(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Nick Low, Head of the Nuclear Issues Section in the Counter-Proliferation Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), on December 14. In a follow-up meeting on December 17, Low told Poloff that he had passed the reftel talking points to colleagues in other FCO departments as well as to the Department for Energy and Climate Change, the Ministry of Defence, and "to Embassy staff at a couple of our missions in key NAM capitals." Low said that he was pleased to report that all colleagues were content with the U.S. message.

2.(SBU) Low complimented the drafter of the talking points, calling the points "very well-written" and commenting that "they cover all the key issues." Low pointed out that the UK had a slightly different position than the U.S. on IAEA funding, but noted that the wording, which speaks of IAEA "resources" rather than "funding" or "finances," causes the UK "no huge difficulty."

3.(U) In addition to POL action on this matter, the Public Affairs section is planning appropriate opportunities to highlight U.S. commitment to strengthening the NPT and overall nonproliferation regime. These opportunities include targeted media engagements by Ambassador Susman in advance of the summit. Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
