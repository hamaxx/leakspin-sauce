Classified By: CDA Michael Gallagher, reasons 1.4 (b,d)

1. (S) Polmiloff discussed reftel O with MFA Senior Advisor
for Nuclear Affairs and Nonproliferation Ceta Noland on April
2, stressing the past involvement of Aviation Services
International (ASI) with the Ghoods Aviation Center (reftels
A-K), and ASI's referral to Inter Connection Technologies
(InCo Tech) to ship connectors used in aviation applications
to Iran (reftels L-N). Noland appreciated the additional
points, but noted that the assessment by Dutch authorities
indicated the connectors were not/not high-density military
grade.

2. (S) Noland said Dutch customs authorities had pulled the
connectors out of the crates, and that Dutch authorities had
determined the connectors could not be used for UAV purposes.
She added that the GONL has placed red flags on any
shipment associated with ASI, InCo Tech, or Iran's Ghoods
Aviation Center -- if there is an even remote chance that a
shipment could be used for UAV purposes, then the Dutch will
issue a catch-all, Noland explained. But in this instance,
she added, the Dutch were reasonably confident that the
connectors could not be used for UAV purposes.

3. (S) While she has not yet received a confirmation, Noland
strongly suspected that the shipment had gone forward. She
said she would pass these additional points to the relevant
Dutch intelligence authorities, but suggested we share our
information indicating the connectors are high-density
military grade with the Dutch through the appropriate
intelligence channels.

Comment
-------

4. (S) Embassy country team agrees that release of any
information regarding the high-density military grade
connectors through the appropriate intelligence channels
would be useful in making our case with the Dutch. End
comment.
