SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: LIBYA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CAR REBELS 
 
REF: STATE 24355 CLASSIFIED BY: Gene Cretz, Ambassador. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

1.(C) Post delivered reftel points via diplomatic note on March 18. We will report any substantive response septel. On Central African Republic (CAR) rebel leader Abdoulaye Miskine's reported ties with the GOL, the French embassy here reports that Miskine has taken up residence at the GOL-owned Hotel Kabiir. CAR President Francois Bozize reportedly told the French Ambassador that he had raised the Miskine issue while travelling to Tripoli in December 2008. Apparently unaware that Miskine was in the country, Muammar al-Qadhafi reportedly offered to have him arrested and delivered to Bozize to take back to Bangui. Bozize declined, apparently due to concerns about how the international community would react. The French assess that al-Qadhafi is "annoyed and jealous" of Gabon's role in the peace process and sought a higher profile for al-Qadhafi as a possible joint mediator. CRETZ
