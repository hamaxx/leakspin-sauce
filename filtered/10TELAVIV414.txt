TAGS PREL, PTER, MASS, SY, LE, IS 
SUBJECT: ISRAELI OFFICIALS REQUEST USG DEMARCHE SYRIA ON 
POSSIBLE MISSILE TRANSFER TO HIZBALLAH

REF: IIR 6-849-9075-10

Classified By: Luis G. Moreno for reasons 1.4 (b),(d)

1. (S/NF) On February 22, 2010, BG Yossi Baidatz, Israel Defense Intelligence (IDI) Chief of Production and Analysis, advised Embassy Tel Aviv officers that IDI had information suggesting Syria intended to imminently transfer SCUD-D missiles to Hizballah in Lebanon. Baidatz explained that IDI viewed completion of such a transfer as creating a “new level of concern” along Israel’s northern border, and he requested that the USG demarche the Syrian government in an attempt to dissuade them from transferring the missiles. Baidatz requested that any demarche be delivered prior to the February 25 arrival in Washington of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Baidatz was concerned that a demarche following Barak’s meeting in Washington would lead the Syrians to believe that the U.S. and Israel collaborated to uncover and thwart the transfer.

2. (S/NF) Embassy Tel Aviv’s Office of Regional Analysis is sending additional details separately.
