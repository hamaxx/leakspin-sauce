SUBJECT: HMG SEEKS U.S. PARTICIPATION IN ESTABLISHING 
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE MILITARY AND SECURITY COMPANIES  

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  

1.  (U) Guidance request.  See para 4.  

2.  (C/NF)  HMG will announce early in January 2009 an interagency initiative on international regulation of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSCs).  The announcement will be in the form of a written ministerial statement, which will include an invitation to all stake holders and interested parties to provide input and guidance during a 12 week consultation process.  

3.  (C/NF)  According to FCO Conflict Group Deputy Head David Hunt, HMG's preference is for a "package of self regulation," to include a code of conduct and standards, rather than a "legalistic, legislative process."  Hunt said HMG would work closely with the British Association of Private Security Companies - a trade standards organization - to help draft and implement the standards.  In order to internationalize the process HMG will seek to work with like-minded states such as the U.S., as well as the International Peace Institute and other NGOs.  The result, Hunt said, would hopefully be a register of compliant PMSCs, established and monitored by an "international secretariat" which could be utilized by states and companies during PMSC contract processes.  

4.  (C/NF)  Guidance request:  HMG would welcome U.S. Government views on the initiative, and information on whether similar processes are underway in Washington.  One area of particular concern, Hunt underlined, is whether NGOs and human rights groups would accept a non-legal, "self-regulatory" process in light of recent indictments of PMSC employees for their actions in Iraq.  HMG would also appreciate an indication from Washington on whether the U.S. Government and other U.S. stake holders would participate in the standards-establishment process.
