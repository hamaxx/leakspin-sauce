SUBJECT: BRAZIL CONSIDERING CAPETOWN CONVENTION ON AIRCRAFT FINANCING REF: BRASILIA 1917 

1. Marcus Vinicius da Costa of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Division of Services, Investments and Financial Issues told Emboff August 13 that the GoB is considering signing the Capetown Convention on Aircraft Financing. In response to lobbying by Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer, which strongly favors GoB adherence to the treaty, the MFA formally has requested comments from the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other interested industry parties. The GoB bureaucratic process is still at a preliminary stage, he said, and obtaining an opinion on the convention from the Ministry of Finance legal department would be the next key step. Noting that U/S Larson had urged Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Appy and International Secretary Pereira to consider adhering to the convention during his July 21 visit (reftel), Emboff encouraged da Costa not to allow the GoB's deliberations to lose momentum.
