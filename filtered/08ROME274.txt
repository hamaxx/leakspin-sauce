1.(U) Econoff delivered reftel non-paper on participation in the Australia Group's Plenary information exchange and experts meetings to Roberto Liotto, the Italian MFA official responsible for GOI participation in the Australia Group (AG). Liotto said that by March 14, he will inform the AG Secretariat of the subject of the GOI presentation and the SIPDIS composition of the GOI delegation, which he will head. The GOI presentation is being prepared by experts at the Ministry of Trade and Italian Customs.
