1.(SBU) Post wishes to alert the Department and Washington agencies per reftel that it has received a report indicating a potential incident of illicit trafficking in radiological materials. This report came to post's attention via a walk-in. Information concerning the report was relayed to PMAT/ISN CTR at 0900 (Washington DC time) on November 13, 2007.

2.(SBU) Details of the incident follow: A) Current location of material: not yet known B) Transport status of material: not yet known C) Assessment of the likelihood that the appropriate authorities can/will secure the material: unlikely. D) If in transit, means of transit: not yet known. E) Intended destination of material: not yet known. F) Routing of material, if via multiple ports: not yet known. G) Supplier and/or origination point of material: Allegedly supplied from a Congolese male named Besto (LNU), the uranium originating from within the Democratic Republic of Congo. H) Type of material: not yet known. A photograph of the wicker-made canister depicts a placard that reads: Zaire CGEA CREN 0.98/7% P.B. 19 kgs P.N. 3 kgs Uranium (note: not all letters are completely legible. This is post's best assessment of the placard). I) Date and time of walk-in: November 12, 2007, 1130am. J) Source of report: Walk-in, xxxxxxxxxxxx K) If an alarm, what type: not an alarm. L) What else if anything was being smuggled with the material: not yet known. M) Specific place where alarm or incident occurred: N/A. N) Additional details: On November 12, 2007 SOURCE approached post about a Congolese male "Besto" who had asked SOURCE and a friend to find a buyer for the uranium. SOURCE claimed the uranium was to be sold for $6 million. SOURCE told Besto they would approach the Iranians, Libyans and Chinese in country to see of their interest in the uranium. SOURCE was told the uranium is in country but does not know this information first hand. At this time RSO can neither assess the validity of the uranium canister nor determine whether it is in Uganda. RSO will report any further developments.

3.(SBU) Action Officer at post for handling this case is ARSO Kevin W. Murphy, reachable via Post One at xxxxxxxxxxxx and email at xxxxxxxxxxxx CHRITTON
