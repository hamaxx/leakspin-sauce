SUBJECT: EU/PAKISTAN: HMG REQUESTS USG INFLUENCE THE SWEDES 
TO MAKE PAKISTAN A PRIORITY  REF: LONDON 2853  Classified By: Political Counselor Rick Mills, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

1. (C/NF) HMG wants to hold an EU-Pakistan Summit under the EU's Swedish presidency in the second half of 2009, but is having trouble convincing the Swedes that a summit would add significant value to what the international community is trying to accomplish in Pakistan, according to FCO Pakistan Team Leader Laura Hickey (protect).  Hickey said HMG wants to hold the summit as a mechanism for building momentum behind EU engagement in Pakistan and hopes that one of the deliverables will be a trade deal (reftel).  Hickey suggested that if the USG communicated to the Swedes the importance the USG attaches to proactive engagement with Pakistan, it would be very helpful in convincing Stockholm.  She noted that the 2009 summits are being finalized this week (December 1 - 5) and that approaching the Swedes on Pakistan, if we chose to do so, would have to happen as soon as possible.  

2. (C/NF) By way of background, Hickey said HMG had recently spoke to the Swedish PM's State Secretary Lind, who said he "wanted to be helpful," but was not convinced a summit added real value.  Lind said the UK stood alone in the EU in arguing for more engagement in Pakistan.  Lind specifically asked if the USG were really concerned about the issue, and noted that he had not heard anything on the topic, which is unusual for matters of import to the USG.  Hickey noted that UK Foreign Secretary Miliband planned to follow up with Swedish Foreign Secretary Bildt.   Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
