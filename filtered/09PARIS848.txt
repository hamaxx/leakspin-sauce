SUBJECT: MADAGASCAR: FRENCH SUPPORT POLITICAL CONSENSUS 
LEADING TO ELECTIONS 

REF: A. EMBASSY ANTANANARIVO-KANEDA E-MAIL (JUNE 23) 
B. PARIS 815 

Classified By: Acting Minister Counselor for Political Affairs Andrew Y 
oung, 1.4 (b/d). 

1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: France continues to favor a political 
consensus among contending parties that would lead to 
credible elections, Presidential AF-advisor Remi Marechaux 
said on June 23. However, neither Rajoelina, Ravalomanana 
(who is recruiting mercenaries in France), nor Ratsiraka are 
making any conciliatory gestures. The international 
community needs to continue pressuring them. SADC's recent 
policy shift is helpful, as is its naming of Joaquim Chissano 
as SADC mediator for Madagascar; the next International 
Contact Meeting should take place in Antananarivo. Marechaux 
denied rumors indicating that France was providing a military 
plane to the HAT; he said that bilateral relations were in a 
"gray zone," with the new French Ambassador not yet having 
presented his credentials. Marechaux said that France was 
abiding by the EU's strictures against "no new 
non-humanitarian assistance," which the EU was enforcing 
strictly. The GOF is trying its best not to embroil itself 
in the dispute over control over Madagascar's embassy in 
Paris. Marechaux labeled French businessman and 
behind-the-scenes fixer Robert Bourgi as an opportunist with 
little experience in Madagascar, who was asked to involve 
himself by Franco-Malgache insider Patrick Lelu (phonetic). 
END SUMMARY. 

CONSENSUS LEADING TO ELECTIONS IS NECESSARY 

2. XXXXXXXXXXXX

11. (C/NF) As had his colleague Romain Serman (ref B, paras 
7-11), Marechaux expressed discomfort with private 
businessman and behind-the-scenes fixer Robert Bourgi's 
apparent involvement in Madagascar. He said that Bourgi had 
no prior experience with Madagascar but had been asked to get 
involved by Patrick Lelu (phonetic), a Franco-Malgache 
businessman and advisor to several leading Malgache figures. 
Marechaux said that Bourgi, looking for new business after 
the death of Gabon's President Bongo, was eager to seek new 
opportunities in Madagascar. Marechaux repeated that Bourgi 
was not in any way associated with the GOF and was interested 
only in exploiting his own opportunities.
