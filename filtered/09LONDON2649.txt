SUBJECT: UK BUDGET SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
 
REF: STATE 120487 
 
1. (SBU) The UK is currently reviewing its plans for budget support for the Palestian Authority (PA) and expects to reach a decision by December 4, Alice Mann, Deputy Head (London), Palestinian Program at the Department for International Development, told ECOUNS. She stated that she is confident that the UK will provide additional assistance, having already provided GBP 18.5 million in budget support this year to the PA. Note: Foreign Secretary Miliband sent a letter to Secretary of State Clinton August 21 noting the UK's contribution this year and expressing that the UK was "keen to provide more budget support" and hoped to have further details on funding plans in early autumn. End Note. Mann said the timetable for such a decision had slipped given other pressing budget concerns.  

2. (SBU) Mann told Econoff that she was pleased to see the U.S. reaching out to other countries for support. She noted that Foreign Ministery and DFID officials have been lobbying other countries, particularly the Saudis, to provide additional support.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
