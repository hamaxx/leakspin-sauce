1.(S/NF) ISN 557 (Ben Qumu Abu Sufian Ibrahim Ahmed Hamouda) was voluntarily repatriated to Libya in September 2007. As of December 25, the date on which a whereabouts and welfare visit occurred under the Watchdog Committee rubric (ref A), ISN 557 claimed to have not had a family visit. A security officer who helped facilitate the December 25 visit indicated at the conclusion of the meeting that a family visit for ISN 557 had been scheduled for December 27.

2.(S/NF) A/DCM spoke with Watchdog Committee counterpart Muhammad Tarnish January 2. Tarnish said ISN 557 had a seven-hour visit with members of his immediate and extended family on December 27 at the facility in which he is detained. Tarnish said he was physically present for much of the visit. ISN 557's relatives were able to bring some food, clothes, personal hygiene items and reading materials to him. Tarnish described ISN 557's physical condition and spirits as "very good" and indicated that security officials at the facility at which ISN 557 is detained had allowed the family to stay with him for a few extra hours in light of the impending New Year's holiday.
