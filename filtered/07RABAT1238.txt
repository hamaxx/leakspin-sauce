SUBJECT: MOROCCAN TROOPS IN COTE D'IVOIRE: INVESTIGATION OF 
MOROCCAN PEACEKEEPERS ON SEX ABUSE CHARGES 
 
REF: STATE 102800 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Thomas Riley for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) In response to the points conveyed reftel, MFA Chief 
of International Organizations Section Nasser Bourita told us 
on July 26 that the GOM takes the accusations of sexual 
misconduct against its troops in Ivory Coast seriously, and 
is sending a high level military delegation to join the UN 
inquiry.  He feels, however, that the GOM troops are 
scapegoats for larger problems surrounding the discipline of 
UN peacekeepers in Africa. 
 
2.  (C) Polcouns and poloff conveyed the USG's concern 
regarding the recent allegations levied against the Moroccan 
United Nations Operations in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI) contingent 
and urged the GOM to conduct a full and fair investigation. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
GOM CONCERNED AND INVESTIGATING 
------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Bourita said the GOM takes these charges seriously 
and planned on sending a high level military delegation to 
serve as part of the UN inquest team in Cote d'Ivoire on July 
30.  The GOM will take decisive action to punish any 
individuals against whom accusations are proven.  The king 
stressed military ethics when he ascended to the throne and 
expects breaches by his forces to be quickly, vigorously and 
transparently investigated at home and abroad. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
TROOPS SCAPEGOATS FOR LARGER UN DEFICIENCIES? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Bourita said, however, the GOM believes the UN is 
scapegoating the Moroccan UNOCI troops to show new resolve in 
the wake of damning reports of smuggling and rape against its 
peacekeepers in Congo.  He protested the sanctions levied 
against the Moroccan troops now in Cote d'Ivoire stressing 
that they arrived little over a month ago, while the 
incidents for which they are being punished occurred over a 
year ago.  When reports of malfeasance first surfaced in 
2005, the GOM removed its troop commander, repatriated him 
for disciplinary action, and has cooperated with the UN 
investigation ever since.  Collective punishment for the as 
yet unproven actions of individuals was unfair.  "How can the 
entire battalion be punished," he asked, "when the alleged 
incidents took place in an area where only 250 Moroccan 
troops were stationed?"  He further argued that GOM troops 
served with NATO in Kosovo and received no complaints. 
Comment: He did not refer to problems Moroccan troops may 
have had in Congo.  End Comment. 
 
------------------------------ 
Peacekeeping, Politics and PXs 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Bourita felt that the GOM troops are caught in a 
political crossfire between Cote d'Ivoire's President Gbagbo 
and some UN members, who oppose UNOCI and its French 
leadership, and are seeking opportunities to discredit the 
mission; and Cote d'Ivoire Prime Minister Soro, who supports 
UNOCI.  As a counter weight to accusations, he pointed to 
press statements by Soro, who led rebels in the area now 
under Moroccan supervision, lauding the GOM's troops.  He 
also mentioned a signed statement sent by civilians in the 
Moroccan zone to the UNOCI Force Commander stating that the 
GOM's troops had shown "irreproachable behavior."   Bourita 
expanded the scope of his complaint saying that there are 
larger structural issues regarding UN peacekeeping command 
and control in Africa that contribute to breakdowns in 
discipline and degradation in troop effectiveness.  Key 
issues he focused on were: 
 
-units are located far from their commanders with poor lines 
of communication and little supervision; 
 
-the UN has no, or insufficient, morale, welfare and supply 
programs, which forces troops to look for incidentals and 
 
entertainment in the areas in which they are posted, 
increasing the opportunity for unsavory incidents to occur; 
 
-six-month operational rotations (as opposed to one to two 
month cycles for European troops) with frequent end-of-tour 
extensions that lead to disgruntlement and breaches in 
discipline. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5.  (C) We will continue to urge a strong response to the 
case as we track the Moroccan side of the investigation. 
Bourita left the impression that the GOM will, in fact, 
conduct a rigorous inquiry with UNOCI in Cote d'Ivoire.  It 
remains to be seen what type of punishment will be meted out 
to troops against whom allegations are proven.  End Comment.
