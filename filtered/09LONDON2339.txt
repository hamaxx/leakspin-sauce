SUBJECT: UK UNABLE TO COMMIT TO SENDING REPRESENTATIVE TO 
JANUARY'S GICNT EPG MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 100994  

1. (SBU) Together with Russian Embassy colleagues, Poloff delivered reftel joint demarche to Sharon McDonald, CBRN Terrorism Desk Officer in the Counter-Proliferation Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), on October 14.  McDonald told Poloff and Sergei Andiashin of the Russian Embassy that she would discuss the January 2010 GICNT EPG Meeting with her supervisors, but that she was at this point unsure whether the UK would be able to send a representative to the meeting.  McDonald cited the ongoing CBRN security strategy review, and said the GICNT was a tool that would be used as part of the UK's comprehensive security strategy.  McDonald also said that resources were scarce and that the CBRN security strategy review was working to develop goals and priorities against which GICNT and other mutilateral partnerships would be measured.  

2. (SBU) McDonald said that if the UK does not send a representative to January's EPG meeting in Budapest, it would still make a monetary contribution.  McDonald also cited other work that the UK is doing with GICNT, such as co-hosting with the U.S. a workshop on detection in March 2010.  She mentioned the possibilty of the UK hosting another workshop focusing on exercise planning; these plans are still in the early stages, however, and if the workshop did occur it would likely not happen until late 2010.
