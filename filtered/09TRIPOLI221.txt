2.(U) Total Accepts Lower Share of Libyan Oil Production: The Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the French oil company Total, continuing its policy of redefining old contracts under the new EPSA-IV framework.

The agreement was approved by the Supreme Oil and Gas Council on February 28 and still requires ratification by the General People's Congress (GPC).

25. (U) Foreign Press to Return to Libyan News-Stands: Libyan al-Ghad company, a private media business set up by Seif al-Islam, is going to distribute 90 Arab and international newspapers and magazines, including the main British, French and U.S. dailies. The Libyan government has long maintained a tight grip on both print and broadcast media. The state-controlled media carries no opinions inconsistent with official policy. For nine months between 2006 and 2007, Libyan authorities had allowed a small number of foreign titles to be sold. In 2007, al-Ghad launched two "independent" dailies and the country's first private television channel; the two newspapers have published criticism of senior officials. The authorities have since further loosened their control over the media, allowing AFP last November to open a bureau in Tripoli and have a permanent foreign correspondent accredited, the first for a global news agency.
