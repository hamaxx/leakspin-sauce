E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS:    
SUBJECT: WAY FORWARD ON AFGHAN JUDICIAL SECURITY INITIATIVE 

REF: A) Kabul 3185; B) Kabul 3419 

1. (SBU) Summary: The Afghan Judicial Security Unit (JSU) is closer 
to becoming operational within Kabul. The U.S. Marshals Service 
(USMS) has completed a security assessment of the Supreme Court and 
determined the number of JSU officers needed to secure the 
Counter-Narcotics Justice Center (CNJC) and the Afghan Supreme 
Court. Training is ongoing for unit members assigned to protect the 
CNJC. The USMS is developing planning documents and identifying 
immediate resource needs as well as possible funding sources to 
enable the JSU grow to accomplish the larger judicial security 
mission described below. As previously reported Ref A, strong USG 
support and significant funding is needed to fully implement this 
important Anti-Corruption/Rule of Law initiative. Post will outline 
specific requests for funding and material support in a future cable 
once Post completes a JSU mission and resource requirement analysis. 
As a judge assigned to the CNJC commented to a DOJ mentor: good 
judicial decisions are directly linked to good security. End 
Summary. 

2. (U) With the completion of a preliminary security needs 
assessment for the Afghan Supreme Court and development of a list of 
needed security upgrades and equipment, the U.S. Marshals Service 
(USMS) and Department of Justice (DOJ), with support from INL, is 
moving forward with standing up the Afghan Judicial Security Unit 
(JSU). INL provided furniture, fixtures, and equipment valued at 
approximately $125,000 for the JSU housing compound, located next to 
the CNJC. Approximately 80% of the furniture was delivered and 
assembled during the last week of October. The remaining furniture 
is expected by mid-November. INL agreed to provide approximately 
$2.1 million annually for O&M; funding for the housing compound for 
the next two years with a target start date of November 24. The 
French government provided initial protective services training to 
the current 54 members of the JSU, and will continue to do so as the 
JSU grows over time until the unit is fully manned and trained. 
Current Afghan JSU officers, with guidance from the USMS, are 
providing firearms training for all CNJC judges. Ministry of 
Interior Deputy Minister for Security Mangal and Deputy Minister for 
Counternarcotics Daoud support moving the JSU from Counternarcotics 
to the Special Operations Police Detachment supervised by DM 
Mangal. 

3. (U) The USMS performed a preliminary assessment and estimated the 
minimum number of JSU officers needed to secure key judicial 
institutions in Kabul, namely the CNJC, the Supreme Court, and the 
Major Crimes Task Force compound (the total number will range from 
245 to 760, depending on whether the judges are housed in compounds, 
or whether the JSU is directed to provide 24/7 personal protection). 
As a limited number of regional courts are identified to try 
anti-corruption and low-level insurgent cases, the USMS, together 
with Afghan JSU officers, will conduct additional assessments to 
determine the security needs of judges working there. These 
assessments will, in part, form the basis to request phased growth 
of the JSU. Action officer level discussions with CSTC-A indicate 
that any JSU growth must fit within the ANP growth plan currently 
under evaluation by the International Community (i.e. grow the ANP 
to a 160,000 person force by 2013). 

4. (SBU) Post has identified the following actions necessary to 
advance and sustain the JSU initiative: (1) Obtain MOI and Supreme 
Court approval of the proposed multi-phased roll-out of the JSU 
expansion, and manage Afghan expectations of the size of the JSU 
force; (2) obtain approval from and U.S. and other donors for 
funding for additional housing for the enlarged JSU force; and (3) 
identify a location and U.S. or other funding for a Judicial 
Security Unit training facility. 

5. (U) Post is also supporting MOI in its efforts to prepare 
documentation that: (1) immediately reassigns the 100 police 
officers designated by DM Mangal in August to the JSU forming a 
single unit under his command; (2) officially defines the JSU 
mission and authorizes JSU officers to wear appropriate civilian 
attire, i.e., plain clothes; and (3) changes the Tashkil (Afghan 
unit manning and equipment document) to place the JSU under the 
direct supervision of the Deputy Minister for Security and to 
provide the JSU with nationwide investigative authority, which is 
necessary for threat and fugitive investigations. 

6. (U) Finally, Post has identified the following immediate resource 
needs: armored vehicles (for which INL has set aside $1.5 million), 
magnetometers, communications equipment, uniforms, including winter 
gear and plain clothes, and security upgrades for the CNJC, 
including a paved road. In addition to utilizing INL funding, the 
Embassy is exploring the possibility of obtaining funding for this 
equipment from other sources, including CSTC-A and international 
partners such as the UK. 

7. (SBU) Comment: Post will continue to engage with Afghan and 

KABUL 00003712 002 OF 002 


international partners to define the scope of the JSU, and to 
identify both immediate and long term sustainment needs and funding 
sources for both. Once mission analysis and resource requirements 
are finalized, Post will outline specific unfulfilled requests for 
funding and material support via cable. The JSU is designed to 
build an effective security unit that will protect facilities, 
judges and at-risk prosecutors and witnesses. It is a vital 
component of our Anti-Corruption and Rule-of-Law efforts. End 
comment.
