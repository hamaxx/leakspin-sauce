SUBJECT: IRAN: HMG "WILL DISCUSS" RAISING CASES OF 
MISSING/DETAINED AMERICANS 
 
REF: STATE 94757 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Greg Berry, reasons 1.4 (b)  and (d).  

1.  (C) Poloff delivered reftel points to Helen Teasdale of the Foreign Office's Iran Bilateral Affairs desk September 16.  Her initial reaction to the request was that given the low ebb of relations between Iran and the UK -- which is still very concerned about the welfare of its local embassy staff members, including one who is currently on trial -- an intervention by the UK may not make much of a difference. None of the nine local staffers, although released from detention, have been able to return to work at the embassy, she noted.  In addition, the UK is working through the EU to secure the release of French citizen Clotilde Reiss, who remains under house arrest at the French Embassy in Tehran. Poloff indicated the USG was approaching a broad range of countries on this issue, and although it is aware of HMG's limited influence over the Iranian government, it hoped that the cumulative effect of many countries raising the issue of the missing and detained Americans would make a significant impact and perhaps speed their release.  

2. (C) Teasdale responded that she would raise the request via internal HMG channels and provide a response as soon as possible. Post will report the results of the HMG internal deliberations as soon as they become available.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
