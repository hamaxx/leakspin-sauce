E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/27/2017 
TAGS:          
SUBJECT: WMD PORTAL DETECTION UPDATE: LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON OPENING THE RAIL CAR REF: A. STATE 163194 B. TASHKENT 2063 C. TASHKENT 2081 D. TASHKENT 2090 Classified By: DTRO Chief Fred Carter and Poloff Steven Prohaska for re asons 1.4 (b, d).

1.(S//NF) Representatives from Uzbekistan's Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) told Defense Threat Reduction Office Chief on December 24 that the rail car interdicted on November 28 (reftels) at xxxxxxxxxxxx has not yet been opened and has not been relocated to xxxxxxxxxxxx. In accordance with Uzbekistan law, the car is being held in abeyance until either the shipper from Kyrgyzstan arrives to explain the detection of radioactivity or until sixty days have elapsed. (Comment: It is very unlikely that the shipper will present himself or herself to explain the contents of the rail car, given the prosecution that would probably ensue. End comment.)

2.(S//NF) INP indicated that the radioactive material is located in the center of the car, and INP requires a minimum standoff distance of five meters from the car. The officials believe that the material is highly contaminated, and their handheld portal monitors suggest that the original source was cesium.
