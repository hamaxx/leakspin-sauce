SUBJECT: ICELAND: AGREE ON CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, DISAGREE ON 
EMBARGO AS A MEANS FOR CHANGE 
 
REF:  STATE 148506 
 
1.  (SBU) Pol Chief passed reftel points as well as President Bush's 
Oct. 24 remarks and the White House fact sheet on Cuba policy to the 
Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 25 October.  MFA 
Minister-Counsellor for International Organization Affairs Nikulas 
Hannigan was appreciative of the additional information regarding 
new USG initiatives to support democracy activists in Cuba. 
 
2.  (SBU) With regard to the Cuban-sponsored UN General Assembly 
resolution against the U.S. embargo, Hannigan noted that this is one 
area in which the U.S. and Iceland have traditionally disagreed. 
While the Government of Iceland shares U.S. concern for the human 
rights situation in Cuba -- and will strongly consider submitting an 
explanation of vote expressing same -- it disagrees with the embargo 
as a good tactic for achieving progress in Cuba.  As a result, the 
MFA sees little reason to alter its historical pattern of voting for 
the resolution.
