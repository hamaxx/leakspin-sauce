E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS:      
SUBJECT:  MDA:  ICELAND WILL BE SUPPORTIVE AT JUNE 20 INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE 
 
REFS:  (A) STATE 95184, (B) STATE 99423 
 
1. (SBU) Post discussed points from refs A and B with Icelandic 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs Human Rights Officer Ingibjorg 
Davidsdottir June 14 and 19, respectively.  Following consultation 
with the MFA PermSec and the Icelandic Mission in Geneva, 
Davidsdottir replied as follows: 
 
-- Iceland will vote against any motion to adjourn the June 20-21 
29th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. 
 
-- The Icelandic delegation in Geneva is prepared to vote in favor 
of the proposed amendments to the Statutes of the International Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Movement should we be unable to approve the 
amendments by consensus. 
 
-- The Icelandic MFA has explained the importance of the red crystal 
issue to its National Society counterparts - who agreed 
wholeheartedly. 
 
-- A representative of the Icelandic delegation will be present as 
much as possible during the Conference. 
 
-- The Icelandic Mission in Geneva is in close contact and 
cooperation especially with the other Nordic countries' and European 
Union's missions in Geneva on this issue. 
 
-- Should the Organization of the Islamic Conference try to steer 
debate in a political direction, Iceland will deliver a statement 
along the lines the U.S. requests if/if its European neighbors are 
doing the same. 
 
2. (SBU) Comment:  Iceland is safely in our corner but will not 
strike any direct blows absent Nordic/European cover.  Such caution 
is characteristic of Icelandic conduct in international 
organizations and especially unsurprising with new Foreign Minister 
Valgerdur Sverrisdottir only in office since June 15.  End comment.
