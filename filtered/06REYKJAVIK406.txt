(SBU) Poloff presented reftel demarches to Icelandic MFA Minister 
Counselor for International Organization Affairs Nikulas Hannigan on 
October 25.  Hannigan, who also covers Middle East issues for the 
MFA, noted that the Government of Iceland agrees with the need for 
balance on UN resolutions concerning the region.  As such, Iceland 
would continue to withhold its support for anti-Israel initiatives 
such as those described in ref A.  Similarly, Hannigan said the GOI 
would study closely the USG position on the Non-Aligned 
Movement-sponsored resolution concerning Lebanon, and would at a 
minimum abstain from voting on the resolution.
