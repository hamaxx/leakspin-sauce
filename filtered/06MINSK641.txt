SUBJECT: BELARUS’ TOP 50 OLIGARCHS

Classified By: AMBASSADOR GEORGE KROL FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D)
1. (C) Summary: Econoff recently received a list purporting to show Belarus’ top 50 oligarchs and their net worth. An internet search found another, slightly older list that is nearly identical to the first. Post cannot confirm the sources or exact information in these lists, but rates the information as being highly credible. These lists read as a “who’s who” of the Lukashenko regime, past and present. Those listed had the opportunity to enrich themselves, and evidence indicates that many did so. End summary.
