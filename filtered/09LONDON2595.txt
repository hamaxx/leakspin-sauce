SUBJECT: UK WANTS LESS UN FOCUS ON ISRAEL; SEES ABSTENTION 
ON GOLDSTONE AS BEST TACTIC 
 
REF: STATE 118799  Classified By: Political Counselor Greg Berry for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( d)  (C/NF)  Greg Quinn, Head of the UN Team in the International Organizations Department, told Poloff on November 19 in response to reftel demarche that the UK agrees that UNGA's excessive focus on Israel wastes resources and takes us farther from a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The only area of divergence between our countries' position is in voting on the Goldstone Report.  Quinn said HMG agrees with the U.S. evaluation of the report's weaknesses and that there was never any chance that the UK would vote to endorse the report.  He also said that the British Embassy in Tel Aviv has reported overall satisfaction with Israeli moves to investigate allegations of improper conduct.  However, he said HMG sees abstention as the best voting tactic, since it is a less-confrontational approach to the Arab states.  Quinn argued it was important to leave a door open to the other Arabs in looking for ways to get negotiations back on track.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
