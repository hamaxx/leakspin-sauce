Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS
1.4 (b), (c), and (d).

1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Berlin

2. (S) Background and Objectives: The United States
has information indicating that the Chinese subsidiary

Organization (DIO), an entity sanctioned under United

understand that as of mid-May 2009, Chinese national

particular test chamber is not controlled by the

necessary to prevent unauthorized retransfers of its
goods by foreign-based subsidiaries - especially to
entities of proliferation concern.
