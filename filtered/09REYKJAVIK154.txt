E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/01/2019 
TAGS:    
SUBJECT: ICELANDAIR ON TRACK TO IMPLEMENT TSA REQUIREMENTS 
 
Classified By: CDA WATSON FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  On August 19, Craig Lynes, Acting TSA 
Representative at U.S. Embassy London and Sandra Melendez, 
TSA International Industry Representative, met with 
representatives of Iceland's Civil Aviation Administration 
and air carrier Icelandair to discuss outstanding issues 
from a routine inspection of airline and airport security 
procedures that took place August 4-6 at Keflavik Airport. 
The meetings were very positive, and the Icelandic 
authorities expressed a commitment to make requisite 
changes.  Many requirements have been implemented 
since the inspection, and several longer-term issues are 
being addressed.  Icelandic officials were very receptive 
to increasing communication with TSA and signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to facilitate sharing 
sensitive security information (SSI).  Icelandic officials 
also responded favorably to TSA's invitation to visit a 
U.S. port of entry.  End summary. 
 
2. (C) TSA Officials Lynes and Melendez met with Petur 
Maack, Director of the Icelandic Civil Aviation 
Administration (CAA), and representatives of Icelandair on 
August 19 to discuss a way forward after the TSA inspection 
on August 4-6 of airline and airport security procedures at 
Keflavik Airport.  Icelandair has been proactive in 
addressing many of the deficiencies identified during the 
inspection.  It reported that about 60 percent of the 
issues had already been addressed and those remaining were 
in progress.  Several outstanding issues, however, 
are not easy fixes.  Some requirements, such as 
implementing open, continuous screening, will requie 
additional funds, which could be difficult to allocate as 
the government is calling for a 10% budget cut in most 
sectors.  In other cases, such as examining footwear of 
select passengers, the CAA must draft legal provisions and issue 
directives.  Despite the challenges, 
Icelandic officials stated their commitment to work with 
TSA make the necessary changes.  TSA expressed a desire to 
return to Iceland at a later date to assess the airport 
again and verify that the requisite changes have been 
made.  Icelandic officials are amenable to the request. 
 
3. (C) TSA made significant progress in increasing its 
lines of communication with Icelandic aviation 
officials.  An MOU was signed to facilitate the sharing of 
SSI. CAA Director Maack was receptive to implementing a 
bilateral information sharing agreement between TSA and the 
CAA so that separate MOUs for each issue, such as threat 
guidance, would be unnecessary.  Also, Maack was very 
receptive to the invitation to view TSA operations at a 
U.S. point of entry and meet with key TSA personnel. 
Funding permitting, he would like to conduct the visit at 
some point this winter.
