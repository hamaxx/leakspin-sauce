SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S INTRODUCTORY CALL ON LORD SPEAKER: 
CONSERVATIVE POLITICS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Louis B. Susman, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

1. (C/NF) Lord Speaker of the House of Lords Baroness Hayman told the Ambassador during a November 6 meeting that in the run-up to the general elections, party politics are beginning to play a role in the House of Lords, especially the public debate over the UK's role in Afghanistan.  She said the expenses scandal had created a very difficult environment in Parliament with a "terrible discontinuity" between the view inside the Houses and the view by the public.  Noting that many peers and members felt "very battered by the press," she said Parliament at present "has not been a very happy place," especially with elections looming.  She said that reform of the House of Lords has changed its role significantly.  With the peers' far-reaching expertise across science, business, the arts, volunteerism, and defense, their scrutiny of legislation and addition of amendments to draft legislation have become more robust.  She noted that the House of Lords has no veto of House of Commons' decisions, but said the upper chamber has the ability to delay legislation and give government a difficult time in passing new legislation.  If the Tories form the next Government, it will be the first time they have not had a clear majority in the Lords and she assessed that many of the "cross-bencher" independents lean toward Labour.
