SUBJECT: NATO RESPONSE FORCE:  ICELAND TO CONSIDER NEW 
PLEDGE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 89347 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL VAN VOORST, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
(C) Post discussed reftel points -- on national force 
contributions needed to achieve NATO Response Force (NRF) 
full operational capability -- with Icelandic MFA Acting 
Political Director Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson June 9.  We 
explained that while we understood that Iceland was not among 
those nations targeted by SHAPE for specific unfilled items 
we hoped it would nevertheless help to diminish remaining 
shortfalls.  Gudjonsson recalled Iceland's 2005 pledge of 
airlift to NRF 7 and reiterated Icelandic commitment to 
burden sharing with Allies.  While noting that on a per 
capita basis Iceland's population of 300,000 has already 
given generously to the NRF, he promised that Reykjavik would 
look closely at what more it could now contribute.
