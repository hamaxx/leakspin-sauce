SUBJECT: UPDATE ON FATHI EL-JAHMI 
 
REF: TRIPOLI 251 
 
PHUM,PREL,LY

CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, Embassy Tripoli, 

Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

1.(C) Following up on a report that detained regime critic Fathi el-Jahmi's health may have sharply deteriorated since the Embassy's visit with him on March 26, Ambassador phoned Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi confidant Munder Ramadan March 29 and conveyed the message that the USG was deeply concerned about el-Jahmi's health and expected that he would receive appropriate medical care pending any arrangements that the Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF) might be making for his treatment abroad (see reftel).

2.(C) On March 30, the QDF's point-person on the issue, Saleh Abdulsalam Saleh, reported to us that he had met with el-Jahmi's doctor earlier in the day and according to the doctor, el-Jahmi's health was now "stable." Saleh faxed us a handwritten medical report from el-Jahmi's doctor, Abdulrahman el-Mahdi, dated March 30, which states in part: "Recently from a few days back, patient suddenly developed severe gastro-enteritis and frequent severe diarrhea on top of other precipitating factors including low oral fluid intake, attack of hyperglycemia, and depression. Because of the above factors, complicated by severe dehydration and hypertension, [the patient suffered from] renal impairment. Then after 48 hours, everything well controlled. Patient now stable clinically and hemodynamically." (Post will fax full medical report to NEA/MAG).

3.(C) Comment: The doctor's report describes what he told us during our visit to el-Jahmi on March 26, i.e., that the patient's condition had worsened on/about March 23 due primarily to dehydration. The report concludes that el-Jahmi's condition is now stable. Given this supposed improvement in el-Jahmi's health, we will continue to press the QDF to proceed with making arrangements for his transfer abroad for treatment. CRETZ
