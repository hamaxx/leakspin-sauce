E.O. 12958:  DECL: 03/20/2019 TAG PTER, PGOV, ASEC, EFIN, ENRG, KCIP, SW 

SUBJECT:  SWEDEN: CI/KR RESPONSE FOR S/CT  

REF: SECSTATE 15113  

Classified By: CDA  Robert Silverman for reasons: 1/4 (B), (D), (E), and (G)  

1. (S) In  response to reftel, post would like to add Sweden's communications  infrastructure to the CI/KR list.  Although Sweden does not posses a  direct undersea cable from the U.S., Sweden is a central European  communications hub.  For example, Swedish company TeliaSonera is an  international carrier that owns and manages 43,000 km of fiber optic  cable linking Russia and the Baltics to the rest of Europe and the U.S.   If these lines of communications were to be destroyed, disrupted, or  exploited, it may compromise global communications.  

2. (S) Post  recommends keeping Swedish pharmaceutical manufacturing company Recip AB  on the CI/KR list for its production of ThyroSafe (potassium iodide).   This resource provides protection in the aftermath of a nuclear  emergency. ThyroSafe is the only FDA approved 65 mg potassium iodide  tablet used to protect the thyroid gland against radioactive iodine  released during a nuclear emergency.
