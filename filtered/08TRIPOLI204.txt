1.(C) P/E Chief conveyed reftel invitation and message from NEA A/S David Welch to MFA Americas Desk Director Muhammad Matari March 6, stressing that a decision by Libya to participate in the U.S.-AMU technical working group on youth de-radicalization would be an important positive gesture. Matari said Foreign Minister Shalgam, in Cairo for the Arab League Ministerial meeting, was due back in Tripoli later that evening and that he would convey the invitation with him immediately with a recommendation that Libya send a delegation.

2.(C) Noting that many Libyan foreign fighters identified in last September's Objective Massey operation along the Syrian-Iraqi border were young men from eastern Libya, P/E Chief said GOL participants in the U.S.-AMU workshop should expect questions about what "soft power" measures might help blunt the appeal of extremist messages there. In that regard, it would be helpful if the GOL chose to include in their delegation officials conversant with the GOL's counter-ideological initiatives and efforts to de-radicalize youth through education and development programs. Matari took the point on board and said he would recommend to FM Shalgam that Libya's delegation include individuals empowered to speak to those issues.
