E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS:     
SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S NEW AVIATION REGULATOR ASKS FOR INVITE TO WASHINGTON 

1. (U) This is an action cable. Please see paragraph 2 and 5 for details. 

2. (U) During an April 7 lunch with Emboffs, Directors Denise Abreu and Leur Lomanto of the newly created National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) asked that the FAA extend a formal invitation to ANAC representatives for May consultations in Washington and Miami. The purpose of their trip would to be to introduce themselves, to explain how ANAC will work and to explore areas of mutual cooperation. While they had planned on an April trip to the US, the deepening VARIG crisis necessitated a delay (septel). 

3. (SBU) The regulators explained that a formal invitation would help them to justify GOB funding of their trip to their superiors. This would be their first formal trip to see foreign aviation regulation authorities since taking office in March 2006. 

4. (U) ANAC was formally inaugurated in a March 20 ceremony in Brasilia and replaces the Department of Civil Aviation (DAC), subsuming all responsibilities for regulations, authorizations and registrations. ANAC will also take over the duties of certifying aircraft, currently performed by the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA) in the Air Force Command. The agency will be headquartered in Brasilia. DAC will heretofore focus on policy and air-traffic control. 

5. (U) ACTION REQUESTED: Post recommends that FAA respond to this request positively. We have a real opportunity to forge strong ties with Brazil's nascent aviation regulator.
