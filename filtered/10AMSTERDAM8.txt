Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) deem appropriate:

3. (SBU) Subject had been employed by the U.S. Embassy in The 
Hague, The Netherlands, as a telephone operator since August 31, 
2009. After a coworker alerted Post's RSO to subject's use of 
workplace computers to browse websites that espoused anti-USG 
points of view, RSO requested post's Information Management 
Officer (IMO) to investigate subject's workplace internet use. 

4. (SBU) IMO's investigation yielded evidence that subject had 
posted information and commentary on 9/11 conspiracy websites. 
Furthermore, on her Facebook page, under the alias XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
she had exchanged views and information with multiple people who 
appeared to espouse jihadist viewpoints. She also posted a 
hyperlink to a YouTube video, Winds of Paradise, which extols 
the virtues of al-Qaeda fighters and jihad, to which she added 
the comment, just beautiful. 

5. (SBU) On February 23, 2010, the RSO and Legal Attache 
confronted subject with records of her internet use and 
subsequently terminated her employment. Subject is now the 
focus of an FBI investigation run from the FBI New York Field 
Office in coordination with post's Legal Attache and RSO. 

6. (SBU) A local check of the Consolidated Consular Database 
indicates no record. Recipients are requested to recheck the 
CCD to verify.
