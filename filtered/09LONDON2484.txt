SUBJECT: SUDAN: UK HOME OFFICE GRANTS NON-ARAB DARFURIS 
ASYLUM 
 
1. (SBU) In a break with the UK's previous policy on granting asylum to Darfuri refugees on a "carefully considered case-by-case basis," the UK Home Office announced November 2 that "all non-Arab Darfuris," who have not committed a serious crime, regardless of political affiliation "qualify for asylum."  The UK Home Office previously held that it "would not be unduly harsh" to expect persecuted Darfuris to relocate to safer regions of Sudan, including Khartoum.  

2. (SBU) The UK Home Office cited a number of recent developments in Sudan that have contributed to the change in policy.  It noted that the March 2009 ICC arrest warrant against President Bashir and the subsequent expulsion of NGOs from Darfur severely limited sources of information and "meant we have been unable to obtain sufficient reliable information to allay concerns of a heightened risk to non-Arab Darfuris in Khartoum."  UK media noted, however, that the Home Office has been fighting a Sudan Country Guidance Case which was due to come to court on November 16 and suggested this may have led to the change in policy.  The Home Office has since withdrawn all negative decisions in the case and announced that the asylum cases involved would be handled in line with the new policy.  Media reporting estimates that the new decision will affect 2,000 plus UK asylum seekers and has been hailed as a victory for NGOs and Diaspora groups involved.
