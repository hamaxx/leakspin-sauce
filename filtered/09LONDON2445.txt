SUBJECT: HMG VIEWS ON ADDING HFCS TO THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL 
 
REF: STATE 95899 
 
(SBU) Steve Reeves, head of the Ozone and Gas Team in the Atmospheric Quality Office at the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), told ESTHOff on October 27 that HMG wants to see a phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and agrees this could be negotiated by parties to the Montreal Protocol.  HMG prefers negotiations to be initiated through "suitable" language in the Copenhagen agreement.  Reeves will represent HMG at the Montreal Protocol Meeting of the Parties (MOP), expected to take place in Port Ghalib, Egypt scheduled for November 4-8, 2009.  This meeting, said Reeves, provides an excellent opportunity to exchange views on these issues.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
