E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/06/2018 
TAGS:    
SUBJECT: 2008 RENEWAL OF PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION (PD) REGARDING BRAZIL'S SHOOTDOWN (ABD) PROGRAM 

REF: SECSTATE 54183 Classified By: DCM Phillip Chicola: Reason 1.5 (d) 

1. (S) Reftel requests that post "evaluate and provide guidance on the following issues: (1) Does the USG provide assistance (funding, intelligence, information, equipment, training, or otherwise) to the GOB that could be used to locate, identify, track, or intercept a civil aircraft? (2) Do any USG entities (corporations or individuals) provide assistance (funding, intelligence, information, equipment, training, or otherwise) to the GOB that could be used to locate, identify, track, or intercept a civil aircraft?" Post is not able to identify USG assistance specifically being used to help Brazil locate, track, identify or intercept civilian aircraft. DEA and INL assist Brazilian counter narcotics efforts but do not have determinations from their headquarters as to which, if any, of their programs might be affected. According to agency repesentatives in Brasilia, DoD and the intel community do provide some information to Brazil on potential drug traffic which would likely be restricted without certification. 

2. (S) Post's views on the importance of recertification will be reported septel. While the specific effects of non-certification are a matter for Washington agencies and their legal advisors to determine, post believes that failing to provide information to Brazilian authorities would increase the flow of illegal drugs through Brazil. It would also result in negative political fallout that would be contrary to overall USG policy of pursuing closer cooperation with Brazil, particularly in the areas of counter narcotics and regional security.
