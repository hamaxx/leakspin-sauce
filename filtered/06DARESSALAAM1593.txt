SUBJECT: URANIUM IN DAR COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO SHIPPING 
COMPANIES, PER SWISS DIPLOMAT

REF: A. DAR ES SALAAM 01376  B. UNVIE VIENNA 00601  C. KINSHASA 01309

Classified By: Charge dâ€™Affaires D. Purnell Delly for reasons 1.4(b),(d) and (e).

1. (C) According to a senior Swiss diplomat, the shipment of uranium through Dar es Salaam is common knowledge to two Swiss shipping companies. Hans Peter Schoni, Counsellor at the Embassy of Switzerland in Tanzania, referred to the allegations of uranium from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) passing through Zambia and Tanzania en route to Iran, but did not attribute to the shipping companies any opinion of the source or destination of the alleged uranium. Poloff pointed out that the reports were unsubstantiated, but Schoni repeated that transport of uranium is common knowledge to the two companies, though no one at either company would admit it in writing. XXXXXXXXXXXX are both based in Geneva and conduct verification and inspection work in Tanzania.
2. (C) Mission has shared this information with all relevant agencies at post which were unable to substantiate this or any other such reports of uranium shipments. Nevertheless, given the potential significance of such allegations we believe it is important to report nonetheless. DELLY
