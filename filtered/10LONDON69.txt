SUBJECT: UK MUST WAIT FOR GENEVA FEEDBACK TO AGREE TO NPT 
JOINT DEMARCHE TEXT 
 

REF: SECSTATE 3073 Classified By: Political Counselor Robin Quinville for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(SBU/NF) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Judith Gough, Deputy Head of the Security Policy Group at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and Delphine Hournau and Zoe Smith, Nuclear Issues Desk Officers at the FCO, on January 13. Hournau and Smith had consulted with Nick Low, Head of Nuclear Issues section at the FCO and the main UK point of contact for NPT issues. (Low is currently in Geneva for P-5 NPT discussions and was part of the January 12 talks in Geneva on this subject.)

2.(SBU/NF) All interlocutors said that they found no problems with the text of the joint demarche but indicated that they needed to wait to hear back from their delegation in Geneva before they could formally agree to the U.S. proposed text. According to Hournau, the joint demarche text may come up for discussion in Geneva later on January 13.

3.(C/NF) Gough and Hournau raised the question of whether Libya was acting on its own and stressed the need to develop a contingency plan in case the joint demarche failed to convince Libya to withdraw its amendment. Hournau said that although the UK supported a joint U.S./UK/Russia demarche, the UK was prepared to go forward without the Russians if the need arose.

4.(SBU/NF) Hournau and Smith said that they would discuss this issue with FCO colleagues on the Libya desk and consult with them about effective methods for dealing with the Libyans.
