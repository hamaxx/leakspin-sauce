SUBJECT: HMG CONSIDERING UPGRADES TO NATO AND BILATERAL 
TRAINING MISSIONS IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 73794  Classified By: Acting Political-Minister Counselor Richard M. Mills, Jr . for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)  

1.  (U)  Request for Guidance; see para 3.  

2.  (C) HMG is currently engaged in a cross-departmental discussion on its training commitments in Iraq, the results of which should become clearer by the end of July.  According to MOD Joint Commitments officer Dan Hughes and FCO NTM-I officer Ian Livingston, the UK concurs with U.S. points reftel on the need for additional training resources for security personnel in Iraq, and to be responsive to PM Maliki's request for a more robust NATO presence.  

3.  (C)  The details on type and quantity of personnel the UK will second are under high level consideration by officials in the MOD, who are aware of U.S. concerns that the additional trainers augment NTM-I, rather than bilateral efforts.  Hughes and Livingston speculated that the additions would likely consist of both bilateral and NTM-I components. Livingston suggested that it may help HMG decision makers if details of USG options on NTM-I expansion could be shared with the UK.  Post requests guidance on a response to MOD and FCO.
