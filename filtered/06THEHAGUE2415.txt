SUBJECT: SIX SUSPECTS ARRESTED FOR JIHAD RECRUITMENT 
 
1.  The National Crime Squad (NR) arrested five men and one 
woman in Amsterdam and The Hague on November 6 and 7 for 
suspicion of recruitment for Jihad, participating in a 
terrorist organization, and obtaining false travel 
documents.  According to the National Prosecutor's Office, 
the arrests are a result of an investigation begun in 
November 2005, when the AIVD intelligence service informed 
prosecutors that three young Muslims from The Hague were 
considering fighting for extremist Islamic ends.  The three 
were later arrested in Azerbaijan by local authorities and 
returned to the Netherlands with help from the Dutch police. 
 
2. The group appears to have been led by Murat , alias 
Ibrahim the Turk, alias Abu Jarah, who reportedly is the 
main suspect and who was among those arrested.  The 36-year 
old Turk was previously tried in 2003, together with nine 
other suspects, for Jihad recruitment, but was released due 
to lack of evidence.  The other five suspects arrested this 
week were not identified publicly, but the prosecutor's 
office stated that some of them may have been involved in 
obtaining false travel documents for Iraq.  Dutch press 
reported that two of the suspects, a 19 year-old woman and 
her Islamic husband, were connected to the ""Hofstad"" terror 
network.  The main Turkish suspect reportedly has been on 
the watch list of international intelligence agencies since 
2000, when he was spotted in Australia collecting money for 
Jihad in Chechnya.  He reportedly was in contact with terror 
suspect Mamdouh Habib, who served three years in Guantanamo 
Bay on suspicion of having ties with Al Qaeda. 
 
3. The NR said that it is continuing its investigation.
