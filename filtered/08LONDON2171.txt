SUBJECT: TFGG01:FM MILIBAND TELLS GEORGIANS UK WILL PROVIDE 
POLITICAL AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Rick Mills for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( d)

1. (C) During his August 19/20 visit to Georgia, FM Miliband pledged to government interlocutors and publicly that the UK will support Georgia's sovereignty, territorial integrity and Transatlantic aspirations, and will work bilaterally and through the EU to address short term humanitarian needs and long term infrastructure rebuilding requirements. FCO Director for Russia, South Caucuses and Central Asia, Michael Davenport, who accompanied Miliband, said that the FM underscored to all interlocutors the UK view that Russian actions had been unacceptable, describing the "occupation" of Georgian territory as a violation of numerous agreements and commitments.

2. (C) During his meetings with the Georgian President and PM, as well as the Speaker of Parliament, Miliband said that NAC foreign ministers had agreed a strong statement in support of Georgia and calling on Russia to withdraw, and had asked him to personally carry their message of solidarity to the Georgian people. All of Miliband's interlocutors stressed the need for economic support and assistance to reconstruct the country's infrastructure in order to restore investor confidence. Miliband pledged UK financial support for Georgia's "Phoenix" reconstruction fund, and committed to an exchange of technical experts to address particular requirements and kick start the economy.

3. (C) According to Davenport, opposition political leaders committed to Miliband that they would "behave responsibly." While many had questions about how the current leadership allowed the situation to develop as it had, none wanted to be seen as doing Russia's bidding by encouraging regime change. The opposition pledged to Miliband that, at least for the near future, it would not make overly critical public statements or take other actions to undermine the government.
