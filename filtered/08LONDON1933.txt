SUBJECT: UNMEE: UK AGREES WITH USG THINKING ON MANDATE'S FUTURE 
 
REF: A. STATE 79539      

B. LORD/KANG/KHAMBATTA/SCHOFIELD EMAILS  Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4(b/d).  

(C/NF) The FCO Peacekeeping Team Leader said on July 24 that although some HMG officials are still grappling over UNMEE's termination because they think the UN could play a valuable role as a deterrent in a return to conflict, the UK supports the U.S. position on non-prejudicial termination of UNMEE. Officials in the FCO's Africa Directorate see "no point" for the mission to continue, especially since Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles has come out strong against a follow-on presence.  HMG would like to see a read-out from SRSG Azouz Ennifar's July 22 meeting with the Ethiopian Deputy Foreign Minister to confirm that Ethiopia has no interest in a follow-on mission of any kind before HMG moves officially forward in support of termination.  HMG agrees that the Security Council should continue to encourage both parties to implement the Algiers Agreement and the Secretary General should continue to engage with Ethiopia and Eritrea in an effort to normalize relations between the two countries.
