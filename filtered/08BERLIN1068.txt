Subject: (s) germany requests release of xxxxxxxxxxxx
nonpaper to the german criminal customs office (zka)

Ref: a. State 77660
b. Berlin 1000

Classified By: Global Affairs Unit Chief Don L. Brown for
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1. (u) this is an action request. Please see para 4.

2. (S) The German MFA requested USG permission to release
the REF A nonpaper to the German Customs Office of Criminal
Investigation (ZKA) (not/not for further dissemination) in
support of a continued investigation. It appears as though
the ZKA investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx is still active,
contrary to a previous MFA statement, but this case has not
progressed to the German court system.

3. (S) On August 4, German MFA Export Control Division Desk
Officer, Wiebke Wacker, told Global Affairs Officer that the
ZKA had asked her office for additional information regarding
the business dealings between xxxxxxxxxxxx
business and Iran's primary solid fuel missile developer, the
Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG). (Comment: Wacker had
previously indicated (REF B) that the ZKA halted their
investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx due to a lack of
evidence linking xxxxxxxxxxxx with SBIG. End Comment). In
response to the ZKA request, Wacker informed the ZKA of the
REF A nonpaper passed to her on July 21 but told them that
she could release the information due to a restriction on
third party dissemination stated in the nonpaper's caveat.
She informed the ZKA that she would make the appropriate
request through U.S. Embassy Berlin. (Comment: It should be
noted that the REF A nonpaper was classified as SECRET//REL
GERMANY, so there might not be any issue releasing this
nonpaper to the ZKA. End Comment).

4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests Department guidance
in responding to the dissemination request posed in paragraph

3. Koenig
