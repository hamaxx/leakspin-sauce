SUBJECT: (S) NETHERLANDS/IRAN: EXPORT CONTROL AUTHORITY TO
APPLY LICENSE REQUIREMENT ON DUTCH FIRM SELLING UAV ENGINES
TO IRANIAN DEALER

REF: STATE 20624

Classified By: Head of Economic Unit Shawn Gray, reasons 1.4 (b),(d)

1. (S) EmbOff met March 10 with Kees Jan Steenhoek, Senior
Policy Advisor, Ministry of Economic Affairs, to discuss
reftel points. Steenhoek is responsible for the GONL's
export control process. He appreciated the information as he
said the GONL had not been aware of AMT Netherlands' exports
to Iran. Steenhoek said the GONL would most likely use a
catch-all procedure under the Missile Technology Control
Regime that will require AMT Netherlands to obtain a license
for all exports of UAV engines to Iran. Steenhoek said he
did not suspect AMT Netherlands was aware of the possible
connection between its customer (Parilla Company) and Iran's
UAV program, in which case he predicted the company would
likely back away from this commercial relationship.
Steenhoek said he would also share reftel points with the
Dutch Intelligence and Security Services (AIVD) as well as
generic lookout information with the Dutch Customs
Administration.
