SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050073566 

REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 

1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2-4. 

2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassies, assistance in conducting a post-shipment check on license 050073566 for the export of Super Tucano aircraft parts to Colombia. Embassies are requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 3. Reason for request: Lack of documentation from Colombian Air Force (CAF), and unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, Darrigo & Valente Transportes, Ltda. (in Brazil). 

4. ACTION Bogota: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with appropriate host government officials to determine if the CAF has received the Super Tucano spare parts from Embraer and that the articles are being used for the purpose stated on the license. Export data indicates that items worth $1,898 shipped from the United States on January 7, 2008. Due to lack of documentation from the end-user, post is requested to exercise its contacts within the Colombian MOD to verify this order. (It may be helpful to reference the Embraer POC, Raul Calminatti, XXXX, Purchase Order No. 900192943 signed October 3, 2007). END ACTION 

BOGOTA ACTION Brasilia: Department requests that Embassy conduct a site visit to Darrigo & Valente Transportes, Ltda. (DVT) in order to verify its bona fides. Embassy is urged to assess DVT,s reliability as a recipient of USML articles, and assess its operations and on-site security. Emphasize that the unauthorized re-export and retransfer of USML items is strictly prohibited. Can DVT provide documentation establishing its order for the items in question and that the CAF is the final end user? END ACTION BRASILIA.
