Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDUARDO AGUIRRE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (C) & (D
)

1. (S//NF) Ambassador raised reftel demarche during a
November 17 meeting with Spanish FM Moratinos. (Note: Other
meeting topics are covered septel. End Note.) Moratinos
stated he was completely unaware of any such deal, but noted
that Iberia was a private commercial enterprise with no
government interest. He and the Ambassador then went through
the reftel talking points carefully. The Ambassador stated
that this was potentially very serious for Iberia and that he
intended to raise the issue with Iberia senior management.
Moratinos acknowledged the potential seriousness of the
issue, but asked the Ambassador to let him (Moratinos) look
into the matter first. The Ambassador said he would welcome
any information Moratinos obtained and that he would wait to
hear from Moratinos before contacting Iberia directly.

2. (S//NF) Ambassador will also raise the issue with GOS VP
Fernandez de la Vega at a scheduled lunch on November 20.
Post will report further as we have more information.
