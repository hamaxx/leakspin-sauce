SUBJECT:  FIRST CASE OF H1N1 INFLUENZA CONFIRMED IN ICELAND 
 
(U) On May 23, Iceland's Chief Epidemiologist Dr. Haraldur Briem 
announced that a case of H1N1 influenza ("swine flu") had been 
confirmed.  The patient, an Icelander, had recently returned from 
New York City.  Initially, it was suspected that six members of his 
family were infected as well but tests have confirmed that the 
family is not infected.  According to Briem, the infected man is not 
critically ill and is on his way to recovery.  Briem also said that 
no extra precautions were being taken beyond health authorities' 
earlier advice to maintain good hygiene standards.  More information 
can be found on the Icelandic Government's swine flu website, 
www.influensa.is.
