SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: IMPLEMENTING UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1874 

REF: A. STATE 65483 B. STATE 66250 C. BERLIN 791 

1. (C) Poloffs delivered refs A and B points to MFA Korea Desk officer Emma Nordlund on June 29, and Pol Counselor followed up with MFA Director General for Asia and Oceania Klas Molin on June 30. On July 13, Molin responded that Sweden is "on board" with the measures called for in UNSCR 1874 but was concerned about French and German draft papers being circulated within the EU calling for additional EU autonomous sanctions on luxury goods (Ref C). Molin stated that the French were also considering targeting the personal finances of DPRK leaders and imposing some sort of visa ban for their travel to the EU. He said he was worried that the DPRK could respond by expelling EU heads of mission from Pyongyang, including Swedish Ambassador Mats Foyer. Sweden's ability to act as protecting power for the United States -- and Foyer's continuing ability to visit the two jailed American journalists -- could be affected. He added that Sweden was worried about the impact of UNSCR 1874 "not just because of you, but also because we believe in dialogue." As of July 13, Molin said, Sweden was still pushing France for "swift implementation of 1874, even if not the maximum amount."

2. (C) Turning to the just-completed visit of ROK President Lee Myung-bak to Sweden, Molin reported that Lee had pushed Swedish PM Reinfeldt hard for "very broad, very forceful" implementation of sanctions under UNSCR 1874. "Let's strangle them to bring them back to the table," Lee reportedly said. Reinfeldt noted the special role Sweden plays as protecting power for the United States, and Lee replied that it was important to maintain the Swedish presence in Pyongyang, but urged again that UNSCR 1874 still be forcefully applied. 

3. (C) Comment: Amb. Molin will be in Washington for consultations July 15-16. EAP interlocutors may wish to raise UNSCR 1874 with him directly, and to address his concerns over tighter enforcement of the UNSCR 1718 ban on exports of luxury goods to the DPRK. End Comment. SILVERMAN
