SUBJECT: REYKJAVIK: NOMINATION FOR FSI ENERGY SEMINAR PE228 
 
REF: STATE 12018 
 
1. Iceland is a key player in renewable energy, especially in the 
field of geothermal power.  The Icelandic Government is 
incorporating this expertise more and more into its foreign policy 
and Icelandic energy companies are investing overseas, including in 
the U.S.  Post nominates Economic and Commercial Officer Fiona Evans 
for the FSI Energy Seminar PE 228 on April 21 - 22, 2008. 
 
2. Nominee info:  Candidate is the Chief of Post's one-officer, 
two-FSN Economic and Commercial Section, which has sole 
responsibility for energy affairs. 
 
Contact information:  Fiona Evans, evansfs@state.gov, Tel: 
+354-562-9100 x2295 or IVG 682-0000 x2295, Fax:  +354-562-9139. 
 
Travel plans:  Tentative plans are for arrival o/a 20 April, 
consultations in Washington 23-24 April, and return to post o/a 25 
April. 
 
3.  Justification: 
 
Country conditions:  With nearly one hundred percent of domestic 
electricity and home heating provided by geothermal and hydro power, 
Iceland is marketing its renewable energy experience around the 
world and is using its clean, green name to increase the country's 
international visibility.  The President is personally vested in 
bringing Iceland to the international forefront and regularly meets 
with USG officials on energy issues.  He is encouraging Icelandic 
direct investment in U.S. geothermal development as well as joint 
investment in third countries.  Iceland's public and private sectors 
are working to create four academic programs in Iceland related to 
clean energy and are seeking U.S. cooperation in development and 
participation.  There is already significant bilateral science 
cooperation in key energy-related fields.  That said, Iceland's 
transportation sector is still highly dependent upon fossil fuels. 
 
Value to candidate:  As Post's lead officer for energy issues, 
nominee advises Ambassador and DCM directly on the course of U.S. 
energy policy towards Iceland.  In day-to-day affairs, Ms. Evans 
conducts dialogue with government and government owned energy 
producers, reports on renewable energy development and related 
innovations, and seeks avenues of bilateral cooperation in renewable 
energy research.  She would benefit from a further grounding in U.S. 
energy policy and global energy markets to increase her 
effectiveness in finding viable solutions to energy security issues. 
 For the U.S. and Iceland to best leverage Iceland's potential in 
energy security and climate change, Post needs in-house expertise on 
the mechanisms and limitations of energy infrastructure and markets. 
 This seminar would demonstrably help to build that expertise.
