SUBJECT: (C) IRANIAN OUTREACH TO LATIN AMERICA 
(C-AL8-02836) 

Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIR., INR/I. REASON: 1.4(C). 

1. (S/NF) WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ASSESS THAT TEHRAN IS 
REACHING OUT TO LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE 
ITS DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION AND INCREASE TIES TO LEFTIST 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION THAT TEHRAN PERCEIVES MAY SHARE ITS 
ANTI-US AGENDA. PRESIDENT AHMADI-NEJAD APPEARS TO BE THE 
DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS POLICY, AND HE HAS RECEIVED 
PERSONAL ASSISTANCE FROM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ. 
IRAN'S TIES WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH INCLUDE MILITARY 
COOPERATION, ARE THE CLOSEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT. GIVEN THE 
HIGH-PROFILE IRAN-VENEZUELA RELATIONSHIP, HIZBALLAH-LINKED 
INDIVIDUALS PROBABLY SEE VENEZUELA AS A SAFEHAVEN WHERE THEY 
CAN CONDUCT FUNDRAISING AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WITHOUT 
INTERFERENCE. OTHER POPULIST GOVERNMENTS LIKE BOLIVIA, 
ECUADOR, AND NICARAGUA HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO CREATE CLOSER 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH IRAN. IRAN HAS ESTABLISHED 
CULTURAL CENTERS IN 16 COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AND HAS 
EMBASSIES IN 10 COUNTRIES. AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT AND
