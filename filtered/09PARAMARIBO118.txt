SUBJECT: SURINAME: VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR RECALLED? 

1. (U) During the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and 
Tobago April 17 - 19, Surinamese President Ronald Venetiaan 
reportedly complained to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 
about the alleged interference of the Venezuelan Embassy into 
Suriname's internal domestic politics. On April 24th, local 
media reported that the Venezuelan Ambassador to Suriname, 
Francisco Simancas, had left Suriname for an unspecified 
period. The Ambassador denied that he was recalled and 
indicated that he was returning to Venezuela for vacation. 

2. (SBU) COMMENT. Locally there is a wide-spread perception 
that the Venezuelan Embassy strongly supports the National 
Democratic Party (NDP), the main opposition to the 
government's ruling New Front-plus coalition of political 
parties. The NDP is led by Desi Bouterse, former military 
strongman and main suspect in the trial of the 1982 murder of 
fifteen political opponents. Venezuelan Embassy staff 
consistently and openly attend NDP events. Reportedly the 
Venezuelans are far less enthusiastic in their support for 
other political parties. Rumors abound that the Venezuelans 
may also be providing financial support to the NDP -- all 
actions potentially perceived to oppose the current ruling 
coalition. END COMMENT.
