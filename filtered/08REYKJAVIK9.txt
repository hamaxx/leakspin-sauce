SUBJECT: POST DOES NOT HAVE FUNDING FOR ICELANDIC WIREC DELEGATION 
 
REF: STATE 5963 
 
In response to reftel request regarding post funding for Icelandic 
delegation to attend the Washington International Renewable Energy 
Conference (WIREC), post has determined that no funding is available 
for this purpose.  Icelandic delegations have previously been able 
to cover their own expenses and we believe that funding is not an 
obstacle to Icelandic representation at WIREC.
