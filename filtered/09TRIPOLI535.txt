SUBJECT: AL-QADHAFI ENCOURAGES U.S. ROLE IN CHAD-SUDAN PEACE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Gene Cretz, Ambassador, Embassy Tripoli, U.S. Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

1.(S//NF) Following his discussion in Sirte on July 2 with Abdullah Sanussi (Director of Military Intelligence and long-time al-Qadhafi confidant) in which they discussed U.S. initiatives to bring peace and relief to Sudan (septel), Special Envoy Scott Gration was called back to Sirte from Tripoli on July 3. After another discussion with Sanussi and other African officials, Gration (accompanied by the Ambassador, GRPO Chief, and Gration Deputy Tim Shortley) met with Libyan Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi who had just finished chairing a non-stop, ten-hour closing session with African leaders. The meeting took place on the dais from which al-Qadhafi had presided over the session.

2.(S) The Special Envoy briefly reviewed what he had been discussing with Libyan officials regarding new U.S. initiatives in the region and potential new cooperation with Libya. He said he was pleased that the U.S. and Libya might be able to be true partners in this endeavor and thanked al-Qadhafi for his efforts to bring peace to the region.

3.(S) Al-Qadhafi expressed his support for U.S. actions in the region and welcomed Washington's and Gration's efforts to resolve problems and bring peace and stability to the area. Al-Qadhafi believed that there was great potential for U.S. resources to be brought to bear positively in what appeared to be a new approach by Washington towards problems on the continent. He lamented that resources had been squandered in the past. The Libyan leader was very optimistic regarding the new tone set by President Obama and said that Libya now trusted Washington's word and America could count on Libya's help and support. He urged Gration to maintain close contact with Libyans involved in these issues. Al-Qadhafi acknowledged that in the past he had differences with the U.S., made it known at those times and "confronted" the U.S. where he believed he had to. Now, he said, that page had turned and the two countries were friends.

4.(U) Special Envoy Gration did not have the opportunity to clear this message. CRETZ
