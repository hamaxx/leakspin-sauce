SUBJECT: AU SUMMIT: A/S CARSON'S MEETING WITH LIBYAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
MUSA KUSA 

CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, US Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 1.(C) In a brief meeting on July 2 on the sidelines of the African Union (AU) Summit in Sirte, Libya, Libyan Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (FM-equivalent) Musa Kusa said Libya had used the AU summit to bring Ethiopian and Eritrean leadership together in an effort to end their proxy war in Somalia. Kusa encouraged A/S Carson to have the U.S. promote security in the Sahel at the July 8-9 G8 meeting in Italy. A/S-equivalent for American Affairs Ahmed Fituri agreed that if Somalia's Transitional Federal Government were to lose ground to al-Shabaab, transnational terrorist organizations would gain a key foothold on the African continent that could quickly spread through the Sahel. Fituri remarked that POTUS' upcoming Africa trip was very important and wished A/S Carson success in his remaining travel schedule. Neither Kusa nor Fituri pressed for a POTUS-Qadhafi meeting at the G8 Summit.

2.(U) A/S Carson has approved this message. CRETZ
