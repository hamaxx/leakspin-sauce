REF:  STATE 146857 
 
(SBU) Pol Chief contacted Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs 
Minister-Counselor for International Organizations Nikulas Hannigan 
on October 25 to follow up on delivery of reftel points.  Hannigan 
noted that the MFA looked favorably on David Walker's candidacy for 
the UN Independent Audit Commission, but that a final decision on 
Iceland's vote had not been made.  He was unwilling to speculate on 
when the MFA would make the final call.
