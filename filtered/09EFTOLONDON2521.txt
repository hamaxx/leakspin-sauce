REF: A. SECSTATE 111689      B. LONDON 2339  

1. (SBU/NF) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Sharon McDonald, CBRN Terrorism Desk Officer in the Counter-Proliferation Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), on November 3.  McDonald said she had already discussed the GICNT EPG Meeting with her supervisors, but that no decision had been made on whether to send a representative.  When asked whether the CBRN Terrorism Desk, the Counter-Proliferation Department, or the FCO needed any additional information about the GICNT that might facilitate its review process, McDonald replied that the UK had the information it needed on GICNT and was now in the process of prioritizing its counter-proliferation commitments.  McDonald will update us as decisions move forward.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
