Classified By: POLECON Counselor Andrew C. Mann for reasons 1.5(b,c) 

1. (C) SUMMARY: The Dutch generally share U.S. views on the 
agenda items for the 12th session of the Human Rights 
Council (HRC). The Dutch are concerned about how to respond 
to Judge Goldstone's report on Israel and Russia's proposal 
to review the HRC process. END SUMMARY. 

2. (C) DUTCH SUPPORT FOR U.S. POSITIONS: Post delivered 
reftel A points to key Dutch MFA contacts, and Pol Deputy met 
with Edwin Keijzer, senior policy officer in the MFA Human 
Rights Directorate, on September 16. Keijzer made the 
following points: 

-- Freedom of Expression: The Dutch do not want the freedom 
of expression resolution to hinder the Allied response to the 
Goldstone report, a higher profile political problem (see 
para 3 below). On the substance, the Dutch are willing to 
support U.S. efforts to find consensus but want wording on 
part 3bis that could create human rights for a religion. 
In addition, the Dutch want to find language to broaden the 
scope of coverage and prevent discrimination based on sexual 
orientation, not just race and religion. Such language would 
need to be general in nature to avoid creating opposition. 

-- Colombia resolution on gender discrimination: The EU has 
not reached consensus on this resolution. The Dutch hesitate 
to create a new institution but want to respond to the new 
laws some nations have enacted in support of discrimination. 
The Dutch expect to follow the EU position, which will likely 
support the resolution. 

-- Technical Assistance to Burundi, Somalia, Cambodia: The 
Dutch support the renewal of these technical assistance 
mandates. For Somalia, it is important to have a clear 
mandate with monitoring. 

-- Russian Proposal on traditional values: The Dutch agree 
the Russian proposal could be problematic in that it could 
easily water down universal human rights. The Dutch would 
need revised text to address that issue before supporting the 
measure. 

3. (C) DUTCH CONCERNS: Keijzer noted also that the Allied 
response to the Goldstone report will be difficult. 
Pakistan's proposed resolution to simply accept the content 
and recommendation of the report is difficult to challenge. 
(Note: Subsequently, FM Verhagen stated publicly that he 
found the Goldstone report one sided, in that it finds 
fault with Israel for not stopping violations by Hamas. 
Verhagen also faults Goldstone for not bringing the report to 
the HRC before passing it to the Security Council. End 
note.) The report could result in ICC and ICJ referrals for 
Israel. In addition, the Dutch are concerned about a Russian 
proposal to review the HRC in Geneva. Responding to a 
demarche, the Dutch told Russian diplomats that a Geneva 
discussion would be too regional, with splits among the 
different regions. The Dutch did not tell the Russians their 
view that a New York discussion would provide for a better 
balance of power for proponents of human rights.
