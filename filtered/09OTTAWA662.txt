SUBJECT: CANADA CONFIRMS COLLAPSE OF FORSYS URANIUM DEAL REF: A. OTTAWA 659 B. OTTAWA 639 C. OTTAWA 627 D. STATE 84119 

Classified By: A/PolCouns Kurt van der Walde, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

1.(S) After close of business on August 28, George Forrest International (GFI) informed Industry Canada officials in writing that GFI had terminated its deal to acquire Forsys Metals Corporation and its Valencia uranium mine in Namibia, according to Sean Caza, Deputy Director for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT). Caza added that Industry Canada has closed its investigation, but DFAIT and Canadian intelligence agencies will continue liaison through established channels with U.S. and other allies to better understand the dynamics underpinning the relationship between GFI and Iran. Caza underlined that Canada will likely need to seek releasable information from the U.S. if GFI or another party seeks to resurrect the deal. He stressed, however, that he had no information that GFI was contemplating this course of action. Visit Canada,s North American partnership community at XXXXXXXXXXXX
