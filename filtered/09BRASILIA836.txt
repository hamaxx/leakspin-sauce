SUBJECT: BRAZIL: CEO FORUM - CO-CHAIR JOSUE GOMES DA SILVA CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR 

(U) This message is sensitive but unclassified, please treat accordingly. REF: Sao Paulo 367 

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In recent conversations with CEO Forum Brazilian co-chair Josue Gomes da Silva, Presidente of Coteminas, prioritized infrastructure investment, private equity, and venture capital as Forum topics, emphasized interest in Brazilian access to Haiti HOPE II, welcomed energy cooperation in the CEO Forum, and suggested the CEOs could address the on-going WTO cotton dispute. Gomes da Silva would like to invite Director of the National Economic Council Summers, Treasury Secretary Geithner, and Energy Secretary Chu and Brazilian Energy Minister Lobao to participate in the Forum. At the Ambassador's request, Gomes da Silva will explore if language referencing the F18 procurement could be included in the Forum statement. END SUMMARY. 

2. (SBU) In recent meetings with the Ambassador, CEO Forum Brazilian co-chair Josue Gomes da Silva indicated that the CEOs will emphasize infrastructure investment, private equity and venture capital on the Forum agenda. Gomes da Silva urged progress on GOB requests for Brazilian participation in Hope II as a way to foster development in Haiti. He hoped the CEO Forum could explore potential solutions to the WTO cotton dispute that would focus on tariffs on goods, rather than on cross-retaliation on intellectual property rights as has been proposed in the Brazilian Congress as an option for MRE to exercise. He intends to keep visa issues and increased airline frequencies on the Forum agenda. Gomes da Silva was enthusiastic about incorporating energy into the CEO Forum. He agreed with the Ambassador that expanding Forum membership to include an eleventh company focused on energy issues should be explored. 

3. (SBU) Gomes da Silva would like Secretary Chu and Brazilian Energy Minister to speak to the Forum during the working part of the agenda. If available, Gomes da Silva hopes NEC Director Summers could address the Forum during the working session or attend the dinner. Gomes da Silva would also like to invite Treasury Secretary Geitner to the Forum dinner. He hopes the CEOs will be able to present their recommendation document to POTUS at the end of the Forum, but emphasized the CEOs would be pleased with POTUS participation wherever his schedule could permit. 

4. (SBU) At the Ambassador's request, Gomes da Silva engaged to explore whether Brazilian CEOs could support a statement on the pending F18 procurement. While Gomes da Silva felt any reference to "military" would be difficult, he thought a reference to increasing economic integration and a "sale between governments" might be possible to gain agreement to include. 

5. (SBU) Gomes da Silva hopes to have a draft working agenda in the next few weeks to share. SOBEL
