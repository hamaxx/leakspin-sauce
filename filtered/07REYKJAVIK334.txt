TAGS:      
SUBJECT: KOSOVO: ICELAND AGREES AHTISAARI PLAN ONLY REAL OPTION 
 
REF: STATE 165486 
 
Classified By: Amb. Carol van Voorst for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C/NF) Ambassador presented reftel points to Gretar Mar Sigurdsson, 
Permanent Secretary of State at the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs, on December 13.  Sigurdsson agreed that an international 
approach based on the Ahtisaari plan presented the only viable option 
for a status solution for Kosovo at this point.  He said that Iceland 
was adopting a wait and see policy for the moment but would 
eventually follow the rest of Europe in recognizing an independent 
Kosovo.  Iceland would be neither the first nor the last country to 
do so.  "In any event, we will be ahead of Norway," Sigurdsson 
allowed in an aside.
